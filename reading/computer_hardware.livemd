## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Overview

Computers are composed of several parts. As programmers, we are primarily concerned about
 the **processor**, and the **memory**.

The processor determines the computer's speed when performing calculations.

Memory or **RAM** (random access memory) determines the amount of data
we can store during a calculation.

In software terms, this translates to the **speed** and **memory consumption** of our program. Generally
as you build software, those are your main performance concerns.

It's not within the scope of the course to provide an indepth understanding of computers and computer hardware.
Here's a great primer by Tom Scott to understand more about what your computer is doing under the hood.

## Memory

We store information in memory. We can think of memory as a series of cells that
can each store some value.

![](images/memory_blank.png)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

The string "hello" might be stored in memory like so.

![](images/hello_stored_in_memory.png)

Under the hood, memory is stored in electrical signals called bits.

Each bit represents `1` or `0` as an `on` or `off` value for an electrical signal.

Eight bits are grouped together to make **bytes**. See [bitstrings](bitstrings.livemd) for more.

Memory is generally measured in kilobytes (`1024` bytes) megabytes (`1024` kilobytes) and gigabytes (`1024` megabytes).

Since they use the metric system, you might expect each to increase by `1000` instead of `1024`.
However, computers use binary numbers, so hardware is built based on powers of `2`.

### Stack Vs Heap

Memory is divided into several parts.

The **stack** holds functions and variables as they execute.

The **heap** is a free memory resource where we can put pretty much any value that we want.

![](images/stack_and_heap.png)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

For example, when you define the variable `hello` and bind it to `"world"`, hello is stored
on the **stack** and it points to the location of memory in the heap.

```elixir
hello = "world"
```

![](images/hello_stack_heap.png)

### Stack Frames

The stack is a LIFO (last in first out) queue.
Instructions stored on the stack create **stack frames**.

As we execute functions, they are stored in a stack frame.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

![](images/stack_frame_steps123.png)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

The last function to be added onto the stack will be the first one executed and removed from the
stack.

![](images/stack_frame_steps4567.png)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

That's why in the code below, `three/0` executes, then `two/1`, then `one/1`.

```elixir
one = fn _ -> IO.inspect("one") end
two = fn _ -> IO.inspect("two") end
three = fn -> IO.inspect("three") end

one.(two.(three.()))
```

### Stack Overflow

The stack has a limited amount of memory allocated to it. When we over-allocate memory on the stack we get stack
overflow. For example, if we continued executing functions in functions eventually the
stack would (generally) run out of space.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Memory Consumption

Whenever we create a value it is stored in memory. If the value is too large, it can consume more
memory than is available on the heap (or is allocated to the program).

For example, loading a large file's contents into memory is a performance concern.

You can see the memory this livebook consumes in the Runtime Settings panel. Press `s` then `r` to open
the settings panel.

![](images/memory_consumption_livebook_runtime.png)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Uncomment the line below and evaluate the cell. You'll notice that the amount of memory consuption
by **Processes** should increase. That's because the `list` must be stored in memory.

Comment the line again and re-evaluate the cell and you'll notice that the memory consuption
goes down because the `list` is no longer in memory.

```elixir
# list = Enum.to_list(1..1000000)
```

### Storage

Generally, we are more concerned about the memory consumption of our program. However, if
our application requires that users download large files onto their computer, it's useful
to be aware of storage.

Files can be saved to the hard drive of a computer. The hard drive is a slower (but generally larger)
storage device. Unlike memory, it is often used for persistent values rather than values which only
exist during the runtime of the program.

For more on memory and storage, you can watch this video by Crash Course Computer Science.

```

## CPU

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes the instructions that you create in your program.

When you perform any operation such as `2 + 2` it is handled by the CPU.

The more instructions you provide to your program, the more work the CPU has to perform. If
there are too many instructions, then the program will take longer to execute.

For example, it's far faster to perform ten addition operations than it is to perform ten million.

Try evaluating the two cells below and notice how the first is far faster (nearly instant).

```elixir
Enum.map(1..10, fn each -> each + 2 end)
```

```elixir
Enum.map(1..10_000_000, fn each -> each + 2 end)
```

## Conclusion

Performance issues can significantly impact a program, leading to slowness or even crashing. Always consider your program's processing and memory constraints and how this might affect your users.

In addition, performance issues generally have a more significant impact on lower-quality computers. Thus, your program may be performant on your personal computer but cause problems on lower-performance hardware.
