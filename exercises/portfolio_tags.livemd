## Blog Tags

You're going to associate each blog with zero or more tags.

Blogs have a **many-to-many** relationship with Tags.

Tags should have `:name` field describing the type of tag such as `"tutorial"`, `"elixir"`, `"testing"`, etc.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Tag {
    name: :string
  }
```

Blogs and tags should be associated through a **join** table `blog_tags`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class BlogTag {
    blog_id: :id
    tag_id: :id
  }
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Comment Requirements

Ensure you:

* Can perform standard CRUD operations for tags.
* Can associate a blog with a tag using a multiple select when you create or update a blog.
* Include a list of a blog's tags on the blog show page.
* Include a show blogs by tag page which displays all blogs that belong to a specified tag. For example: `"/blogs/tags/:id` where `:id` is the id of a tag.

## Bonus: Search By Tag

Add a feature to the blog search form to search for blogs by tag.

## Commit Your Progress
