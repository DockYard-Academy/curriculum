## Animal Generator

Often we need to create large amounts of fake data in order to test our applications. To simulate this experience, you're going to build data for an animal simulator game.

Each animal will be represented with a map. Each map should have the keys `name`, `animal_type`, and `age`.

Use the following names, species, and age ranges to generate your animal data. You may alter this to suite your own creative preferences!

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
names = ["Clifford", "Zoboomafoo", "Leonardo"]
animal_types = ["dog", "lemur", "turtle"]
ages = 1..14
```

Your list of animals should include every permutation of names, species, and ages. There are `126` permutations in the data examples above.

Consider using `names`, `animal_types`, and `ages` as generators for a comprehension.

```elixir
names = ["Clifford", "Zoboomafoo", "Leonardo"]
animal_types = ["dog", "lemur", "turtle"]
ages = 1..14

for name <- names, animal_type <- animal_types, age <- ages do
  %{name: name, animal_type: animal_type, age: age}
end 
```

Enter your solution below.
