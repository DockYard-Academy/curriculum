## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Review Questions

* How can you use the file system for long-term persistence and retrieval of elixir terms?
* What is the absolute and relative **path**?

## Persistence

So far, we've only been able to persist values during the **runtime** of our application. This is a form of **short-term** persistence that ends the moment we stop our application.

Alternatively, we can have **long-term** persistence mechanisms that persist after we stop our application and will be unchanged the next time we start the application.

Using the file system is one form of long-term persistence. When we save a file, we save it to a storage device on our computer, usually a [solid state drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) or [hard disc drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive).

Short-term persistence is instead stored in [Random Access Memory (RAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Random-access_memory), usually referred to as simply "memory". See [Computer Hardware](computer_hardware.livemd) for a further breakdown of how hardware and software relate to each other.

## File

We use the [File](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html) module for working with the file system and the [Path](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html) module for working with file paths.

Many [File](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html) operations mimic terminal functionality and even use the same names in a Unix (MacOS or Linux) environment.

For example, we have the [File.ls/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#ls/1) function, which lists folders and files in the current path.

```elixir
File.ls!()
```

This mimics the `ls` command that also lists files in the current directory in Linux and macOS.

```
$ ls
CONTRIBUTING.md  README.md  data  exercises   flake.nix  reading                      scripts       utils
LICENSE          _build     deps  flake.lock  images     removed_content_tracking.md  start.livemd  v_graph.livemd
```

```elixir
Path.absname("exercises")
```

## Absolute Path Vs Relative Path

The **absolute path** is the absolute path to a file relative to the computer's root directory. For example, we can see the absolute path of the current file using [__DIR__](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.13/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#__DIR__/0).

```elixir
__DIR__
```

The **relative path** is the relative path to a file relative to the current directory location. For example, if we have the following folder structure:

```
main_directory/
  sub_directory_1/
  sub_directory_2/
```

If we were in `sub_directory_2`, the relative path to `sub_directory_1` would be `"../sub_directory_1"`.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Current Directory

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

The [File](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html) module uses relative paths based on the current directory. The current directory will depend on how you start livebook. We can see the current path using the [Path](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html) module to get the absolute name of the current path.

```elixir
Path.absname("")
```

## File Module Functions

The [File](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html) module has many useful functions for working with the file system.

We'll have the opportunity to learn more about the [File](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html) module and the various functions during the [drills exercise](../exercises/file_drills.livemd). For now, here are some common functions to get you started.

* [File.cd/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#cd/1) change the current directory.
* [File.dir?/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#dir?/2) check if a given path is a directory.
* [File.exists?/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#exists?/2) check if a file exists.
* [File.ls/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#ls/1) list all files and folders in the current directory.
* [File.read/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#read/1) read content from a file.
* [File.rm/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#rm/1) remove a file.
* [File.rm_rf/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#rm_rf/1)remove files and directories in a given path.
* [File.mkdir/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#mkdir/1) create a directory given a path.
* [File.mkdir_p/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#mkdir_p/1) create a directory and any missing parent directories given a path.
* [File.write/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#write/3) write content to a given file path.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

We can create a file using [File.write/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#write/3).

```elixir
File.write("file.txt", "file content")
```

To prove we created the file, we can read the content using [File.read/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#read/1).

```elixir
File.read("file.txt")
```

The file is now in our list of files.

```elixir
File.ls()
```

To clean up the file, uncomment the following code which should remove it.

```elixir
File.rm("file.txt")
```

Now the file should no longer exist. Let's check with [File.exists?/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#exists?/2).

```elixir
File.exists?("file.txt")
```

### Your Turn

Experiment with the functions above. Refer to the documentation for examples you can try.

<div style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; padding: 1rem; color: white; margin: 1rem 0;">
DO NOT DELETE IMPORTANT FILES ON YOUR SYSTEM WHEN USING THE FILE MODULE
</div>

```elixir
File.mkdir("to_delete")
```

```elixir
File.write("to_delete/file.txt", "hello, world.")
```

```elixir
File.rm_rf("to_delete")
```

## Path Module Functions

The [Path](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html) module contains many useful functions for working with the paths to files.

We'll have the opportunity to learn more about the [Path](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html) module and the various functions during the [drills exercise](../exercises/file_drills.livemd). For now, here are some common functions to get you started.

* [Path.absname/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html#absname/1) convert the given path into an absolute path.
* [Path.dirname/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html#dirname/1) return the directory portion of a given path.
* [Path.join/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html#join/2) join two paths. This is much more reliable than string concatenation.
* [Path.split/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html#split/1) split a path into a list on each directory separator `/`
* [Path.wildcard/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html#wildcard/2) return a list of files that match the provided expression.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

[Path.join/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html#join/2) is especially useful, as it's easy to make mistakes using string concatenation. Notice below that we accidentally join `folder` and `more` together to make `foldermore`.

```elixir
path1 = "path/to/folder"
path2 = "more/path/to/file.txt"

path1 <> path2
```

[Path.join/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Path.html#join/2) is smart enough to treat these as separate folders to make the path.

```elixir
path1 = "path/to/folder"
path2 = "more/path/to/file.txt"

Path.join(path1, path2)
```

### Your Turn

Experiment with the functions above. Refer to the documentation for examples you can try.

```elixir
Path.absname("")
```

```elixir
Path.wildcard("lib/livebook/*.e*")
```

```elixir
Path.wildcard("../projects/games/*.ex*")
```

## Bang Functions

Many functions in the [File](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html) module have a bang version ending in `!`.

Bang functions raise an error if they fail.

```elixir
File.ls!("invalid")
```

Regular functions typically return an `{:ok, value}` or an `{:error, reason}` tuple.

```elixir
File.ls("invalid")
```

Use a bang function if you expect that the function should always succeed or if you want to raise an error. Use a regular function if you want specific error handling or don't care if the function fails.

For example, if we're reading a file but not sure if it exists or not, we might use [File.read/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#read/1). If we think the file should always exist (and want to crash our program if it doesn't), we use [File.read!/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#read!/1).

## Persisting Erlang Terms

[File.write/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#write/2) does not work with many non-string elixir terms. We'll get a `:badarg` (bad argument) error when we try.

```elixir
File.write("data/erlang_term", %{1 => 2})
```

To get around these issues we can use `:erlang.binary_to_term/1` and `:erlang.term_to_binary/1` which convert an elixir term to and from binary.

When creating the file, we need to convert the Elixir term into binary using `:erlang.binary_to_term`

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph Writing
  direction LR
  1[Term] --> 2[Binary] --> 3[Write]
end
```

```elixir
:erlang.term_to_binary(%{key: "value"})
```

When reading the saved binary, we need to convert it back into an elixir term using `:erlang.term_to_binary/1`.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph Reading
  direction LR
  A[Read] --> B[Binary] --> C[Term]
end
```

```elixir
binary =
  <<131, 116, 0, 0, 0, 1, 100, 0, 3, 107, 101, 121, 109, 0, 0, 0, 5, 118, 97, 108, 117, 101>>

:erlang.binary_to_term(binary)
```

Now we can write an Elixir term in it's binary format, then read the file.

```elixir
:ok = File.write("binary.txt", :erlang.term_to_binary([1, 2]))

{:ok, binary} = File.read("binary.txt")

[1, 2] = :erlang.binary_to_term(binary)

# cleaning up the file to avoid saving a file on your computer.
File.rm("binary.txt")
```

## Handling Large Files

Using [File.read/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#read/1) loads all of a file's contents into memory. This causes performance issues when dealing with large files, or when dealing with many files.

To avoid performance issues we have two options. We can use [File.stream!/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#stream!/3) to treat the file as a stream. Or we can use [File.open/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#open/3) and [File.close/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#close/1) with the [IO](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.html) module to open a file, and read/write it's contents more selectively.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Streams

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

To stream a file, use [File.stream!/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#stream!/3). By default, each element in the stream will be one line of the file. See [Streams](./streams.livemd) if you need a refresher on working with streams.

```elixir
content = """
line 1
line 2
line 3
"""

File.write!("stream.txt", content)

stream = File.stream!("stream.txt") |> IO.inspect(label: "Stream")

Enum.to_list(stream) |> IO.inspect(label: "Lines")

# cleaning up File
File.rm("stream.txt")
```

### IO and the File System

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

We use [File.open/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#open/2) and [File.close/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#close/1) to open a file and perform some operations, then close it when we're finished.

While the file is open, we use [IO.read/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.html#read/2) and [IO.write/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.html#write/2) to read and write to the file. The [IO.read/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.html#read/2) function can read a new line each time we call it.

```elixir
File.write!("open_close.txt", content)

{:ok, file} = File.open("open_close.txt")

IO.read(file, :line) |> IO.inspect()
IO.read(file, :line) |> IO.inspect()
IO.read(file, :line) |> IO.inspect()
IO.read(file, :line) |> IO.inspect()

File.close(file)

# cleaning up file.

File.rm!("open_close.txt")
```

[IO.write/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.html#write/2) writes over the entire content of the file. We need to open the file with the `:write` option to enable write permission.

```elixir
File.write!("open_close.txt", content)

{:ok, file} = File.open("open_close.txt", [:write])

IO.write(file, "written content")

File.close(file)

File.read("open_close.txt") |> IO.inspect(label: "Updated File")

# cleaning up file.
File.rm!("open_close.txt")
```
