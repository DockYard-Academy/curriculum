## Pokemon API

We can request information about Pokemon using the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/).

When we rely on an external API, it's possible for them to change the format of a response, and have that cause issues
for our application.

That's why it's often important to translate information from an API into a struct when we retrieve it. This way
if the format of the API response changes then we can fix the issue in a single spot where we convert the API response into a struct.
We can also keep only the information we want, rather than all of the data returned.

```elixir
{:ok, response} = HTTPoison.get("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/charmander")
```

In the `Pokemon.from_response/1` function,
Decode the above `response` into an Elixir map using the [Poison](https://hexdocs.pm/poison/Poison.html) library.
then use the converted response to create a `Pokemon` struct with `:name`, `:weight`, and `:height` fields.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Pokemon.from_response(response)
%Pokemon{name: "charmander", weight: 85, height: 6}
```

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
defmodule Pokemon do
  defstruct [:name, :weight, :height]

  def from_response(response) do
    nil
  end
end

Pokemon.from_response(response)
```

### Types (Bonus)

Add `:types` to the `Pokemon` struct and use the `"types"` field from `response` to create a list of types.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Pokemon.from_response(response)
%Pokemon{name: "charmander", weight: 85, height: 6, types: ["fire"]}
```
