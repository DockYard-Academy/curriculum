## Games: Benchmarking

In your existing [Games](./games_setup.livemd) project, you're going to benchmark your [Wordle](./games_wordle.livemd) application.

First, add [Benchee](https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee) to your existing list of dependencies.

You're going to run benchmarks in your ExUnit test suite. Since benchmarks are usually expensive, you'll create a custom `:benchmark` tag and
exclude this tag from tests in `test_helper.exs`.

You should be able to run benchmarks using the `--only=benchmark` or the `--include=benchmark` flag.

```
mix test --only=benchmark
```

Benchmark the `Games.Wordle.feedback/2` function you previously created. Refactor your solution and try to optimize its performance.
