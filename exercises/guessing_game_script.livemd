## Guess the Number

In this exercise, you will create an Elixir script to run a guessing game from
the terminal.

Create a `guess_the_number.exs` script in the projects folder, which you should be able to run with:

```
$ elixir guess_the_number.exs
```

Each time the script is run, it should generate a random number.

The script should prompt the user for a guess (You can use `IO.gets/1` for this).

If the guess is correct, print "Correct!". If it is incorrect, print "Incorrect!"
