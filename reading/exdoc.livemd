## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## ExDoc

[ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) takes the documentation we define in our project using `@moduledoc` and `@doc` and generates the same documentation we've see on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_doc/readme.html).

To add ExDoc to a mix project, we install it in our list of dependencies in `mix.exs`. The latest version is on [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_doc). We only need documentation for the `:dev` environment, and we do not need it during runtime.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:ex_doc, "~> 0.28", only: :dev, runtime: false}
    ]
  end
```

Install dependencies.

```
$ mix deps.get
```

Then generate documentation for the project.

```
$ mix docs
```

This creates a `docs/` folder. Inside the docs folder is an `index.html` file.
`HTML` stands for hyper-text-markup-language. It's the code used to structure a web page and its content.

You can open the `docs/index.html` file in your browser to view the project documentation.

### Your Turn

Previously you converted a `Math` module into a mix project in the [ExUnit with Mix](./exunit_with_mix.livemd) section.

Add [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) to your `Math` project. When finished, Open the `index.html` file in your browser, and you should see a page similar to the following.

Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-exdoc
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish exdoc section"
