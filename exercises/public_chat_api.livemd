## Public Chat API

We have created a public chat application you can [visit in your browser](http://localhost:4000).

To chat on this chat application users need to make a HTTP POST request.

Use [HTTPoison.post/3](https://hexdocs.pm/httpoison/HTTPoison.html#post/3) to send a message to the chat API.

The HTTP POST body should be a JSON string with a "body" field. i.e. `"{\"body\": \"hello!\"}"`.
The HTTP POST headers should include the `Content-Type` field to specify that the data being sent is JSON.

Ensure that your message appears on the [chat application](http://localhost:4000/).

```elixir
HTTPoison.post("http://localhost:4000", "{\"body\": \"hello!\"}", [
  {"Content-Type", "application/json"}
])
```
