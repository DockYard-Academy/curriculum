## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Overview

Control flow. What does that mean?

Well, so far you've learned mostly about how to give computers a single set of instructions.
But sometimes, depending on certain conditions, you want to deliver a different set of instructions.

```mermaid
flowchart
  Input --- Condition
  Condition --- 1[Instruction]
  Condition --- 2[Instruction]
```

The flow of our program through these branches, and how we control it is called **control flow**. We have a variety of tools to control the flow of our program including `if`, `cond`, and `case` statements.

## If Statements

We've already seen `if` statements, which are a useful when we have one or two branching paths in our code.

For example, we might build a weather app that provides recommendations of what to wear.

We'll have some condition like **if it is cold** then provide a recommendation to **wear a coat**. If it is not cold, then we'll provide a recommendation to wear a t-shirt.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart LR
weather --> hot --> t-shirt 
weather --> cold --> coat
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Here's how we can translate that into a program.

```elixir
weather = :cold

if weather == :cold do
  "coat"
else
  "t-shirt"
end
```

`if` statements are only effective for up to two paths. We'll likely have to write overly verbose solutions that involve re-binding a variable if we try to use them for multiple conditions.

This is not recommended. For example, let's expand our weather application to handle many conditions, instead of only hot and cold.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart
weather --> sunny --> r1[t-shirt]
weather --> snowing --> r2[thick coat]
weather --> rainy --> r3[rain coat]
weather --> foggy --> r4[something bright]
```

```elixir
# Change :sunny to :snowing, :raining, and :foggy to see a different result.
weather = :sunny

recommendation = "t-shirt"
recommendation = if weather == :snowing, do: "thick coat", else: recommendation
recommendation = if weather == :raining, do: "raincoat", else: recommendation
recommendation = if weather == :foggy, do: "something bright", else: recommendation

recommendation
```

### Your Turn

Create a thermometer program that determines if the temperature is `:hot`, or `:cold`. Bind a variable `temperature` to a number between `0` and `20`. If the temperature is above `10`, then return `:hot`, otherwise return `:cold`.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
temperature = 10

if temperature > 10 do
  :hot
else
  :cold
end
```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir

```

## Clear Control Flow

Control flow impacts the complexity of a program. The more branching paths we have in our program, the more complex it is.

Some complexity is necessary, but overly complex programs are often the result of improper use of control flow.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart
  A[Input] --> B[Decision]
  B --> B1[Decision]
  B --> B2[Decision]
  B --> B3[Decision]
  B1 --> B11[Decision]
  B1 --> B12[Decision]
  B1 --> B13[Decision]
  B2 --> B21[Decision]
  B2 --> B22[Decision]
  B2 --> B23[Decision]
  B3 --> B31[Decision]
  B3 --> B32[Decision]
  B3 --> B33[Decision]
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

We can simplify our programs by reducing the number of branching decisions and leveraging different control flow structures.

## Case

`case` is a control flow structure that allows you to define a series of cases, and handle them separately.

`case` is best used when you have many branching conditions, that all work well with pattern matching.

We'll use this to improve our weather application that handles many different conditions.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart
weather --> sunny --> r1[t-shirt]
weather --> snowing --> r2[thick coat]
weather --> rainy --> r3[rain coat]
weather --> foggy --> r4[something bright]
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

We can break this control flow down into several cases.

* Case 1: It's sunny so wear a t-shirt.
* Case 4: It's snowing so wear a thick coat.
* Case 2: It's raining so wear a raincoat.
* Case 3: It's foggy so wear a something bright.

Here's how we translate that into code. This is significantly more straightforward than our solution using `if`.

```elixir
# Change :sunny to :snowing, :raining, and :foggy to see a different result.
weather = :sunny

case weather do
  :sunny -> "t-shirt"
  :snowing -> "thick coat"
  :raining -> "raincoat"
  :foggy -> "something bright"
end
```

### Case Breakdown

Let's break down the `case` statement above. To use a `case` statement, start with the `case` keyword.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
case
```

Then enter a value that will match one of the cases. This can be a variable, or any elixir term. We'll use "sunny" from above.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
case :sunny
```

Now write the `do` keyword to start defining the series of potential cases.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
case :sunny do
```

Defining the "sunny" case. We'll trigger the case that matches the value between `case` and `do`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
case :sunny do
  :sunny
```

We separate the pattern to match on with the code to run if it matches using the `->`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
case :sunny do
  :sunny ->
```

We then provide the code to run when the case hits. In this case, `"t-shirt"`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
case :sunny do
  :sunny -> "t-shirt"
```

Then we `end` the case statement.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
case :sunny do
  :sunny -> "t-shirt"
end
```

We can provide any number of cases. Cases use pattern matching to decide which result to run.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

Return each value from `1` to `5` by changing the `condition` variable below.

```elixir
condition = nil

case condition do
  :red -> 1
  "blue" -> 2
  %{key: "value"} -> 3
  123 -> 4
  [1, 2, 3] -> 5
  _ -> "default"
end
```

## Pattern Matching With Case

`case` uses pattern matching to determine which case to run. If the left side of the `->` operator would match with the provided value, then the `case` statement returns the right side of the `->` operator.

Exact values always match.

```elixir
case {:exactly, :equal} do
  {:exactly, :equal} -> "I hit this case"
end
```

Under the hood, Elixir checks if the condition, and the left side of the `->` symbol would match.

```elixir
{:exactly, :equal} = {:exactly, :equal}
```

If the values would throw a [MatchError](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/MatchError.html) with the match operator `=`, then they do not match.

```elixir
{:not_exactly, :equal} = {:exactly, :equal}
```

That's why the following `case` statement does not trigger the `"non-matching case"`.

```elixir
case {:exactly, :equal} do
  {:not_exactly, :equal} -> "non-matching case"
  {:exactly, :equal} -> "matching case"
end
```

We can use pattern matching the same way we already have with the match operator `=`.

```elixir
{_mostly, :equal} = {:exactly, :equal}
```

So now, by matching on `:exactly` using a variable, we can trigger the first case below.

```elixir
case {:exactly, :equal} do
  {_mostly, :equal} -> "matching case"
  {:exactly, :equal} -> "exactly equal case"
end
```

`case` statements will raise a **CaseClauseError** if the value provided doesn't match any case.

```elixir
case "no match" do
  :sunny -> "t-shirt"
end
```

To provide a default case for the `case` statement, you can use a variable, which pattern matches with any Elixir value.

```elixir
case "no match" do
  "sunnny" -> "wear a t-shirt"
  anything -> "wear clothing"
end
```

We're not using this variable, so we should preface it with an `_`.

```elixir
case "no match" do
  "sunnny" -> "wear a t-shirt"
  _anything -> "wear clothing"
end
```

It's common to simply use an `_` rather than naming the variable.

```elixir
case "no match" do
  "sunnny" -> "wear a t-shirt"
  _ -> "wear clothing"
end
```

### Your Turn

Return each result from `1` to `5` by changing the `condition` variable below.

```elixir
condition = nil

case condition do
  [1, 2, 3] -> 1
  [_head | _tail] -> 2
  {_, _} -> 3
  %{key1: _, key2: "value"} -> 4
  {1, _, %{key: [1, _, _]}} -> 5
  _ -> "default"
end
```

## Cond

`cond` stands for **condition**. `cond` is best used for control flow with many branching paths that does not work well with pattern matching.

For example, if we expand our weather application to handle conditions that depend on a range of temperatures.

* If the temperature is below `5` degrees: wear a thick coat.
* If the temperature is `5-10` degrees: wear a coat.
* If the temperature is `11-15` degrees: wear a light coat.
* If the temperature is `16-20` degrees: wear a heavy shirt.
* If the temperature is `21+` degrees: wear a t-shirt.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart
temperature --> t1[0<] --> r1[thick coat]
temperature --> t2[5-10] --> r2[coat]
temperature --> t3[11-15] --> r3[light coat]
temperature --> t4[16-20] --> r4[heavy shirt]
temperature --> t5[21+] --> r5[t-shirt]
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Here's how we can translate this into a program using `cond`.

```elixir
# Change temperature to change the condition triggered.
temperature = 6

cond do
  temperature >= 21 -> "t-shirt"
  temperature >= 16 and temperature <= 20 -> "heavy shirt"
  temperature >= 11 and temperature <= 15 -> "light coat"
  temperature >= 6 and temperature <= 10 -> "coat"
  temperature <= 5 -> "thick coat"
end
```

`cond` accepts a truthy value on the left-hand side of the arrow `->` and returns the expression on the right-hand side of the arrow for whichever condition returns `true` first.

This means that order does matter. Here, even though the integer is above `5`, it will never trigger the second condition, because the first condition is always true.

```elixir
value = 10

cond do
  is_integer(value) -> "value is an integer"
  value > 5 -> "value is above 5"
end
```

Generally, we want more specific conditions to be higher in priority than less specific conditions.

```elixir
value = 10

cond do
  value > 5 -> "value is above 5"
  is_integer(value) -> "value is an integer"
end
```

Like `case` statements, `cond` will raise an error if we don't trigger any condition.

```elixir
cond do
  false -> ""
end
```

We can provide a default condition using `true`.

```elixir
cond do
  false -> ""
  true -> "default condition"
end
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below:

* Create a variable called `grade` which will be a number grade from 1 to 100.
* Create a condition that returns `"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`, or `"D"` depending on the value of `grade`.

The conditions for `grade` should be:

* 85-100 is an A
* 70-84 is a B
* 55-69 is a C
* 1-54 is a D

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

We can solve this problem being very explicit about each condition.

```elixir
grade = 0

cond do
  85 <= grade and grade <= 100 -> "A"
  70 <= grade and grade <= 84 -> "B"
  55 <= grade and grade <= 59 -> "C"
  1 <= grade and grade <= 54 -> "D"
end
```

Or we can make use of order to make the code more concise.
However, this wouldn't reveal if `grade` were an invalid value
such as `-5`, `110`, or `"hello"`.

```elixir
cond do
  grade >= 85 -> "A"
  grade >= 70 -> "B"
  grade >= 55 -> "C"
  true -> "D"
end
```

</details>

```elixir

```

## Unless

`unless` is `if` in reverse. It's helpful for times when you want to always do something unless
some condition is true.

For example:

* Unless it rains on sunday lets go to the park.
* Unless it is the weekend you work.
* Unless it's high tide, lets go to the beach.

```elixir
unless false do
  "Hello!"
end
```

```elixir
unless true do
  "Hello!"
end
```

```elixir
is_raining = false

unless is_raining do
  "Let's go to the beach!"
end
```

You can also use `else` with unless but it's not always the most clear to read and should probably
be an `if` instead.

```elixir
condition = true

unless condition do
else
  "Will I print?"
end
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below

* Create a variable named `tired` which is `true` or `false`.
* Create an `unless` statement. which returns `"awake"` unless `tired`.

```elixir

```
