## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively, you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Lesson

Keyword lists are lists with keys. Each key associates with a value.

```mermaid
flowchart
  key1: --> Value1
  key2: --> Value2
  key3: --> Value3
```

Keyword lists belong to a family of data types known as **associative data structures**.
you'll also often hear it referred to as a **key-value data structure**.

In Elixir, the key is an atom, and the value can be any data structure, even another keyword list.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
[key: "value"]
[atom: "anything!"]
["You can use quotes for the atom key!": ""]
[snake_case_is_convention: ""]
[ButThatIsNotEnforced: ""]
```

Keys in a keyword list do not have to be unique.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
[my_key: "value", my_key: "value"]
```

Elixir allows you to work with keyword lists in this nice `[key: "value"]` syntax. However,
keyword lists are actually just a list of tuples where the first element is an atom.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
[{:key, "value"}]
```

In the Elixir cell below, you can see how Elixir converts lists of tuples matching the `{:atom, value}` syntax
into a keyword list.

```elixir
[{:key, "value"}, {:key, "value"}]
```

If you break the convention in the keyword list, Elixir reverts to displaying
the keyword list as a list of tuples.

```elixir
[{}, key: "value"]
```

List order is guaranteed, so the same is true for keyword lists.

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, create a keyword list of your favourite super hero. Include their `:name` and `:secret_identity`. Replace `nil` with your answer.

```elixir
hero = nil

Utils.feedback(:keyword_list_hero, hero)
```

## Keyword List Operators

You can also use `--` and `++` with keyword lists.

```elixir
[one: 1, two: 2] -- [one: 1]
```

If you add a list to a keyword list, you'll notice that the keyword list element will
evaluate as a tuple again. Remember that keyword lists are simply lists of tuples with an atom and a value.

```elixir
[one: 1] ++ [1]
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, use `++` to add `[one: 1]` to `[two: 2]` to make `[one: 1, two: 2]`.

```elixir

```

Remove `[two: 2]` from `[one: 1, two: 2]` to make `[one: 1]`.

```elixir

```
