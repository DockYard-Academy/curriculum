## Anagram

Two words that contain all the same letters are anagrams.
For example **bored** and **robed** are anagrams.

* Create a function `anagram?/2` which determines if two strings are anagrams.
* Create a function `filter_anagrams/2` which filters a list based on if they are anagrams of a provided string.

    Enum.filter(words, fn word -> anagram?(word, string) end)
  end

  defp sort_string(string) do
