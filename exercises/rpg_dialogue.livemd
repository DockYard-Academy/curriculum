## Overview

In this exercise, you will create dialogue for an RPG (Role Playing Game).

To generate this dialogue define a `Character` struct with a `:name`, `:class`, and `:weapon` keys. Enforce that the `:name` key must have a value.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Character {
    name*: string
    class: string
    weapon: string
  }
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
defmodule Character do
  @enforce_keys [:name]
  defstruct @enforce_keys ++ [:class, :weapon]
  
  def introduce(character) do
    "My name is #{character.name}."
  end

  def attack(character) do
    "I attack with my #{character.weapon}!"
  end

  def class(character) do
    "I am a #{character.class}"
  end

  def war_cry(character) do
    "My name is #{character.name} and I am a #{character.class}!"
  end

  def defeat(character1, character2) do
    "My name is #{character1.name} and I have defeated the #{character2.class} #{character2.name}!"
  end
end
```

</details>

Then implement the `Character` functions to generate dialogue according to the documented examples below.

```elixir
defmodule Character do
  @moduledoc """
  Character

  Defines a character struct, and functions for creating character dialogue.

  iex> %Character{name: "Frodo"}
  %Character{name: "Frodo", weapon: nil, class: nil}

  The :name key is required.

  iex> %Character{name: "Frodo"}
  ** (ArgumentError) the following keys must also be given when building struct Character: [:name]
  """
  defstruct []

  @doc """
  Introduce the character by name.

  ## Examples
    
    iex> Character.introduce(%Character{name: "Gimli"})
    "My name is Gimli."

    iex> Character.introduce(%Character{name: "Aragorn"})
    "My name is Aragorn."
  """
  def introduce(character) do
  end

  @doc """
  Declare a character attack.

  ## Examples

    iex> Character.attack(%Character{name: "Gimli", weapon: "axe"})
    "I attack with my axe!"

    iex> Character.attack(%Character{name: "Aragorn", weapon: "sword"})
    "I attack with my sword!"
  """
  def attack(character) do
  end

  @doc """
  Declare a character's class.

  ## Examples

    iex> Character.class(%Character{name: "Gimli", class: "warrior"})
    "I am a warrior."

    iex> Character.class(%Character{name: "Aragorn", class: "ranger"})
    "I am a ranger."
  """
  def class(character) do
  end

  @doc """
  Declare a character's name and class in a war cry.

  ## Examples

    iex> Character.war_cry(%Character{name: "Gimli", class: "warrior"})
    "My name is Gimli and I am a warrior!"

    iex> Character.war_cry(%Character{name: "Aragorn", class: "ranger"})
    "My name is Aragorn and I am a ranger!"
  """
  def war_cry(character) do
  end

  @doc """
  Declare that one character has defeated another.

  ## Examples

    iex> Character.defeat(%Character{name: "Gimli"}, %Character{name: "Aragorn", class: "ranger"})
    "My name is Gimli and I have defeated the ranger Aragorn!"

    iex> Character.defeat(%Character{name: "Aragorn"}, %Character{name: "Gimli", class: "warrior"})
    "My name is Aragorn and I have defeated the warrior Gimli!"
  """
  def defeat(character1, character2) do
  end
end
```

### Bonus: Character Instances

Bind three variables `aragorn`, `gandalf`, and `gimli` to an instance of a `Character` struct with the following information.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class aragorn {
    name: "Aragorn"
    class: "ranger"
    weapon: "sword"
  }
  class gandalf {
    name: "Gandalf"
    class: "wizard"
    weapon: "staff"
  }
  class gimli {
    name: "Gimli"
    class: "warrior"
    weapon: "axe"
  }
```

Use may these three structs to test your `Character` functions.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
aragorn = %Character{name: "Aragorn", class: "ranger", weapon: "sword"}
gandalf = %Character{name: "Gandalf", class: "wizard", weapon: "staff"}
gimli = %Character{name: "Gimli", class: "warrior", weapon: "axe"}

# Example Testing
Character.introduce(aragorn)
```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir

```

### Bonus: Handle `nil` Fields.

For each function in the `Character` module above, handle when `:class` or `:weapon` fields are `nil`.

For example, you might have a default response.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
# normal
Character.attack(%Character{name: "Gimli", weapon: "axe"})
"I attack with my axe!"

# handling nil value.
Character.attack(%Character{name: "Gimli"})
"I attack!"
```

You have complete creative control over how you would like to change the dialogue when fields used the the body of the functions above are `nil`.
