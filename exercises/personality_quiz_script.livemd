## Personality Test

In this exercise, you will create an Elixir script to run a personality test from
the terminal.

Create a `personality_test.exs` script in the projects folder, which you should be able to run with:

```
$ elixir personality_test.exs
```

This will be a two choice personality test. You have creative freedom over what you would like the personality test
to decide.

For our example, we'll use a "Are you a dog person or a cat person?" test.

The personality test will ask the user 5 questions. Each question has 2 choices which help determine if they
are one personality type or another.

For example,

1. Do you love to go for walks? yes/no
2. Do you value your alone time and need a lot of it? yes/no
3. Are you generally high energy? yes/no
4. Do you prefer sports or reading a book? sports/book
5. Water or soda? water/soda

You can use [IO.gets/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.html#gets/1) to ask the user questions from the script.

Once finished with the quiz, it should print out a result based on their answers.

```elixir
"You are a Dog person!"
```
