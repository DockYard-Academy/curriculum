## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Booleans

Booleans (BOO-LEE-ANS) are `true` and `false` values in your code. They are often useful for
representing conditions and triggering actions in your program.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
true
false
```

As part of programming, you'll often create branching paths. Essentially there are multiple things that could happen depending on certain conditions. We often call this **control flow**.

Let's take an example and say we have a program that controls a light.
Either we can tell the light to power `on` or power `off`. In this case, `on` would be `true` and `off` would be `false`.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[is_powered] --> true --> on
  A[is_powered] --> false --> off
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, turn the power on in our light control program to see the light turn on! Replace `false` with `true`.

<!-- livebook:{"attrs":{"code":"power = false","source":"content = if power, do: \"/images/on.png\", else: \"/images/off.png\"\nKino.Image.new(File.read!(__DIR__ <> content), :png)","title":"Power on!"},"kind":"Elixir.Visual","livebook_object":"smart_cell"} -->

```elixir
power = false
content = if power, do: "/images/on.png", else: "/images/off.png"
Kino.Image.new(File.read!(__DIR__ <> content), :png)
```

```elixir
YouTube.new("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI-qXk7XojA")
```

## Boolean Operators

Using the **boolean operators** `and`, `or` and `not` we can compare and manipulate booleans.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### `and`: Check If Two Booleans Are `true`.

Returns `true` if left and right-hand side are true. Returns `false` if either the left side and/or right side of the operator are `false`.

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
  A[true] --> C
  B[true] --> C
  C[and] --> D[true]
```

```elixir
true and true
```

```elixir
true and false
```

```elixir
false and true
```

```elixir
false and false
```

### `or`: Check If One Or More Booleans Are True.

Returns `true` if either the left side or the right side of the operator are `true`.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
  A[false] --> C
  B[true] --> C
  C[or] --> D[true]
```

```elixir
true or true
```

```elixir
true or false
```

```elixir
false or true
```

```elixir
false or false
```

### `not`: Flip A Booleans Value

Flips `false` -> `true` and `true` -> `false`.

```elixir
not true
```

```elixir
not false
```

## Strict and Non-Strict Operators

`and`, `or`, and `not` are strict boolean operators, meaning they should only be used with booleans, otherwise they will raise an error.

```elixir
1 and 1
```

Sometimes we want to make logical comparison using **truthy** and **falsy** values. `nil` and `false` are falsy values, and everything else is a truthy value.

We can use non-strict boolean operators `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not) to work with truthy and falsy values.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### `&&` Check If Two Values Are Truthy.

Returns the right-hand side value if the left-hand side value is truthy.

```elixir
1 && 2
```

Returns the left-hand side value if it is falsy.

```elixir
nil && 2
```

```elixir
false && 2
```

### `||` Checks If One Or More Values Are Truthy.

Returns the first truthy value on either the left-hand side or the right-hand side.

```elixir
2 || nil
```

```elixir
1 || 2
```

```elixir
nil || 2
```

### `!`: Flips the Falsy Or Truthy Value to `true` Or `false`.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Flips truthy -> `false` and falsy -> `true`.

```elixir
!1
```

```elixir
!nil
```

## When Should You Use Strict Or Non-strict Operators?

You might wonder why you shouldn't simply always use non-strict operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` since they also work with booleans.

```elixir
true && true
```

```elixir
false || true
```

```elixir
!true
```

The primary reason is communication. We want our code to communicate to other developers, so it's useful to use `and`, `or`, and `not` to communicate to other developers reading our code that we are working with boolean values.

Generally, prefer `and`, `or`, and `not` with booleans, and use `&&`, `||`, and `!` with non-boolean values.

## Control Flow

By comparing booleans, you can create branching paths in your code depending on certain conditions.

For example, let's say we're building a weather app. This app might send morning notifications to users
to let them know that it's going to be a sunny day.

You might check that the user **is subscribed**, that it **is morning**, and that it
**is sunny**. If all of these things are true, then we want to send a notification.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[is subscribed] --> and
  B[is morning] --> and
  C[is sunny] --> and
  and --> true
  true --> D[send notification]
  and --> false
  false --> E[don't send notification]
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

We can cleverly use boolean operators to write this logic. Try changing any of the `true` values to `false` and you'll see we no longer simulate sending a notification.

```elixir
is_subscribed = true
is_morning = true
is_sunny = true

is_subscribed and is_morning and is_sunny && "send notification!"
```

### `if`

Rather than rely on boolean operators entirely, it's more common to use specific control flow structures. For example, we can replicate the code above using [if](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/case-cond-and-if.html#if-and-unless) statements.

```elixir
if is_subscribed and is_morning and is_sunny do
  "send notification"
end
```

### `else`

`if` statements allow use to trigger some code when some condition is truthy. We often use `if` statements in combination with `else` statements to create two separate branching paths in our code.

For example, let's say we're creating a coin flip game. The user provides a `guess` of `:heads` or `:tails`, and we have `coin` flip of `:heads` or `:tails`.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart LR
if/else --> c[coin == guess] --true--> w[You win!]
c --false--> l[You lose!]
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Here's how we could write this in code. Try changing `guess` to `:heads` to win the coin flip game.

```elixir
coin = :heads
guess = :tails

if coin == guess do
  "You win!"
else
  "You lose!"
end
```
