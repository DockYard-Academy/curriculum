## Authorized Blog Page

You're going to add authorization to your blog.

All users should be able to view all blogs, however only authorized users should be able to create, edit, and update their own blogs.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Authorization Requirements

Ensure you:

* Allow all clients to access the `:index` and `:show` actions for blogs.
* Allow only authenticated users to access the `:new`, `:create`, `:edit`, `:update`, and `:delete` actions for their own blogs.
* (BONUS) Add a `:user_name` field to each user. Each username should be unique.

Remember to use the `mix phx.gen.auth` command to generate the initial authentication system.

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the curriculum folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.
Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-portfolio_auth_blog_page
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish portfolio auth blog page exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-portfolio_auth_blog_page
