## Engineering Journal

It's genuinely a great habit to keep an engineering journal.
You can use your engineering journal to track how you solve problems and what your work on.
It's also excellent practice with Git, GitHub, and markdown.

You may use any method (such as GitHub Desktop, or the command line) to accomplish the following.

In this exercise

* create a local git project called `engineering_journal`.
* create your first journal entry as a `.md` file. Name the file after a topic, or todays date. i.e. `2022-03-28.md`.
* stage and commit the journal entry.
* create a remote repository for `engineering_journal`.
* push your changes to the remote repository.

Once finished, we highly recommend you use this as an engineering journal to track things you learn about Elixir.

### Bonus: Foam

You may also be interested in the [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) project for Visual Studio Code. Foam provides useful features such as hyperlinks and a graph visualization of all your notes.

Follow the [Foam Getting Started Guide](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#getting-started) and install the [Recommended Extensions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/getting-started/recommended-extensions).

Create a new foam note, and include a hyperlink. Run the `Foam: Show graph` command to see a graph of your notes that have hyperlinks to each other.

Foam makes for an even better engineering journal, because you can create notes for specific topics, and create hyperlinks between notes to store everything you learn about that topic.

It's also excellent practice for learning Markdown.
