## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively, you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Livebook

This lesson is going to be very meta. We're talking about
Livebook within a Livebook.

Livebook is an interactive and collaborative code notebook for Elixir.
It's commonly used as a documentation tool, and this is
the first course to use it so extensively for teaching Elixir.

Inside these interactive notebooks, we can write formatted content (like you're reading right now)
and execute Elixir code.

## Markdown

Livebook allows us to create `.livemd` files that power
the interactive notebooks that you've read so far!

`.livemd` stands for **live markdown**. Markdown is
a lightweight markup language that allows you to write
formatted content using only special symbols. It's like writing a formatted google document with only text.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
**bold**
*italic*
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

You can view the [Markdown cheat-sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for
an overview of markdown syntax.

Markdown is everywhere! It's even valid input for chat apps like Slack and Discord.

## Cells

Livebooks are split into **cells**. There are **markdown cells** which allow for the creation
of styled text using the formatting markers just described.
As you hover and click your cursor <i class="ri-cursor-fill"></i> on a markdown cell. You'll notice each
has a <span style="color: rgba(101,131,255,.5)">blue</span> highlight on the left
and some controls.

You can edit <i class="ri-pencil-line"></i>, move up<i class="ri-arrow-up-s-line"></i>,
move down <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-line"></i>, and delete <i class="ri-delete-bin-line"></i> cells.

You can also upload images <i class="ri-image-add-line"></i>.

While completing interactive reading material and exercises, you generally do not need to use these controls.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Hover and click on this markdown cell to see the controls. Click the <i class="ri-pencil-line"></i> edit button
to see the Markdown content inside.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Elixir cells contain Elixir code. Evaluate the cell to show the result.

You can click on an Elixir cell to see the <i class="ri-play-circle-fill"></i> Evaluate button.
Alternatively you can evaluate an Elixir cell by clicking on it the cell and pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows & Linux) or <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (MacOS).

Click on the Elixir cell below and then click <i class="ri-play-circle-fill"></i> Evaluate to see the result. You
should see `10` because `5 + 5` equals `10`.

```elixir
5 + 5
```

The result of the cell is the last value in the cell. For example, this cell
returns `10`.

```elixir
5
10
```

You can also evaluate every Elixir cell in a notebook by pressing <kbd>e</kbd> and then <kbd>a</kbd>. You need to be
in **Navigation mode**. Navigation mode is the default mode. If you are editing a markdown cell or
Elixir cell, then you are in **Insert mode**.

Click on the keyboard shortcuts <i class="ri-keyboard-box-line"></i> icon on the sidebar to view
available Livebook shortcuts depending on the current mode.

## Evaluation

By default, Elixir cells evaluate in order when you run the `ea` command. Cells above
automatically evaluate when you evaluate a cell below.

Here are two empty Elixir cells. By default, an empty cell returns `nil`.

```elixir

```

```elixir

```

Evaluate the first cell and notice that the cell below becomes **Stale**.

This means that if the second cell relies on any value in the first cell, it is now outdated.

If you change a cell, **Evaluated** changes to *Evaluated* to indicate that the cell has changed
since the last time, it was evaluated.

Evaluate the Elixir cell below, then change `5` to `4` to see **Evaluated** change to *Evaluated*.
Re-evaluate the cell to see *Evaluated* change to **Evaluated**.

```elixir
5
```

## Formatting

You can format Elixir code using the <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (Windows & Linux) Keybinding or <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>OPTION</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (MacOS).

Try uncommenting the following code (Remove the `#` character) then press <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (Windows & Linux) or <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>OPTION</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (MacOS) to format the code.

Notice that the `1 + 1` code moves to the left.

```elixir
#               1 + 1
```

If you have not evaluated any Elixir code cells, you may see a warning.

> You need to start a runtime (or evaluate a cell) to enable code formatting.

Ensure you evaluate any Elixir cell before attempting to use the code format command.

If you cannot format an Elixir cell, you can use this as a clue that you have a syntax error in your code. For example, the following
code is invalid. Notice that you cannot use <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> to format the code.

```elixir
          1 +
```

## Tests

Throughout this course, you will perform exercises with test feedback. Under the hood we use a project called [ExUnit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.html) which you will use in the future to write tests.

Evaluate the Elixir cell below to see a failing test. Then change `4` to `5` to see a passing test.

<!-- livebook:{"attrs":{"assertions":"assert five == 5","attempts":1,"code":"five = 4","solution":"five = 5","title":"Exercise"},"kind":"Elixir.TestedCell","livebook_object":"smart_cell"} -->

```elixir
ExUnit.start(auto_run: false)

defmodule Assertion do
  use ExUnit.Case

  test "Exercise" do
    try do
      Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)
      five = 4
      assert five == 5
    catch
      error ->
        flunk("""
          Your solution threw the following error:

          #{inspect(error)}
        """)

      :exit, {error, {GenServer, message_type, [_pid, message, _timeout]}} ->
        flunk("""
            GenServer crashed with the following error:

            #{inspect(error)}

            When it received: #{inspect(message)} #{message_type}

            Likely you need to define the corresponding handler for #{inspect(message)}.

            Ensure you defined a handle_call/3, handle_info/2, or handle_cast/2 or appropriate handler function.

              def handle_call(:message, _from, state) do
                ...
              end

            Also ensure you call GenServer.call/2, GenServer.cast/2, or otherwise send the message correctly.

              GenServer.call(pid, :message)
        """)

      :exit, error ->
        flunk("""
          Unhandled exit with the following error:

          #{inspect(error)}
        """)
    after
      # all warnings and errors are printed to the previous Kino Frame
      # to avoid cluttering the test results display.
      Process.sleep(10)
      Kino.render(Kino.Markdown.new("### Test Results
<hr/>"))
    end
  end
end

ExUnit.run()

# Make variables and modules defined in the test available.
# Also allows for exploration using the output of the cell.
# Unfortunately, this results in duplication of warnings.
five = 4
```

Let's break down the test feedback.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
1) test  (Assertion)
     reading/livebook.livemd#cell:5
     Assertion with == failed
     code:  assert five == 5
     left:  4
     right: 5
     stacktrace:
       reading/livebook.livemd#cell:7: (test)



Finished in 0.00 seconds (0.00s async, 0.00s sync)
1 test, 1 failure

Randomized with seed 613714
```

ExUnit tells you that the test failed.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Assertion with == failed
```

Then it may provide information about the test being run. You may not be familiar with
this code, and that's perfectly OK.

For this example, the test asserted that the answer should have been 5.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
code:  assert five == 5
```

Generally, **left** is the provided answer, and **right** is the expected answer.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
left:  4
right: 5
```

Passing tests are more straightforward. Each `.` is a passing test.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
.

Finished in 0.00 seconds (0.00s async, 0.00s sync)
1 test, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 736220
```
