## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Create the Perfect AI

You're going to create the perfect AI for rock paper scissors that will always win.

```mermaid

scissors --beats--> paper --beats--> rock --beats--> scissors
```

Generate a random player choice of `:rock` ,`:paper`, or `:scissors` or manually enter `:rock`, `:paper`, and `:scissors` to determine your program works correctly.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
player_choice = Enum.random([:rock, :paper, :scissors])
```

Then, return the winning choice of either `:rock`, `:paper`, or `:scissors` that beats the player's choice.

  ```elixir

  case player_choice do
    :rock -> :paper
    :paper -> :scissors
    :scissors -> :rock
  end
  ```

## Create Two Player Rock Paper Scissors

Now that you know how to create a rock paper scissors AI, you're going to create a two player game of rock paper scissors.

Bind a `player1_choice` and `player2_choice` variable to `:rock`, `:paper`, or `:scissors`.

* If `player1_choice` beats `player2_choice`, return `"Player 1 wins!"`.
* If `player2_choice` beats `player1_choice`, return `"Player 2 wins!"`.
* If both players have the same choice, then return `"Draw"`.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <summary>Example solution</summary>

  ```elixir
  player1 = :rock
  player2 = :scissors

  case {player1, player2} do
    {:rock, :scissors} -> "Player 1 Wins!"
    {:paper, :rock} -> "Player 1 Wins!"
    {:scissors, :paper} -> "Player 1 Wins!"
    {:rock, :paper} -> "Player 2 Wins!"
    {:paper, :scissors} -> "Player 2 Wins!"
    {:scissors, :rock} -> "Player 2 Wins!"
    {_same, _same} -> "Draw"
  end
  ```

  You can also reduce code repetition using functions and the `in` keyword to check if the value exists in a list.

  ```elixir
  player1 = :rock
  player2 = :scissors

  beats? = fn choice1, choice2 ->
    {choice1, choice2} in [{:rock, :scissors}, {:paper, :rock}, {:scissors, :paper}]
  end

  cond do
    beats?(player1, player2) -> "Player1"
    beats?(player2, player1) -> "Player2"
    player1 == player2 -> "Draw"
  end
  ```
