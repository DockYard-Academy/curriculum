## Guess The Word

In the Elixir cell below create a word guessing game.

* Bind a variable `guess` to the player's guess as a string.
* Bind a variable `answer` to the actual answer as a string.
* Check that the `guess` matches the answer. Bind `correct` to `"Correct!"`
  if the answer and guess match or `"Incorrect."` if they don't.

Run the code with a correct and incorrect `guess` to ensure
your code passes the tests.

<!-- livebook:{"attrs":{"assertions":"assert Enum.all?([guess, answer, correct], &is_binary/1),\n  \"Ensure `guess`, `answer`, and `correct` are all strings\"\n\nif guess == answer do\n  assert correct == \"Correct!\"\nelse\n  assert correct == \"Incorrect.\"\nend","code":"guess = nil\r\nanswer = nil\r\n\r\ncorrect = nil","solution":"correct = if guess == answer, do: \"Correct!\", else: \"Incorrect.\""},"kind":"Elixir.TestedCell","livebook_object":"smart_cell"} -->

```elixir
ExUnit.start(auto_run: false)

defmodule Assertion do
  use ExUnit.Case

  test "" do
    guess = nil
    answer = nil

    correct = nil

    assert Enum.all?([guess, answer, correct], &is_binary/1),
           "Ensure `guess`, `answer`, and `correct` are all strings"

    if guess == answer do
      assert correct == "Correct!"
    else
      assert correct == "Incorrect."
    end
  end
end

ExUnit.run()

# Make variables and modules defined in the test available.
# Also allows for exploration using the output of the cell.
guess = nil
answer = nil

correct = nil
```

## Guess The Number

In the Elixir cell below create a number guessing game.

* Bind a variable `guess` to the player's guess as an integer.
* Bind a variable `answer` to the actual answer as an integer.
* If `guess` equals `answer` bind `correct` to `"Correct!"`
* If `guess` is less than `answer` bind `correct` to `"Too low!"`
* If `guess` is greater than `answer` bind `correct` to `"Too high!"`

Run your code with an equal, smaller, and larger `guess` than the `answer` to ensure your
code passes all tests.

<!-- livebook:{"attrs":{"assertions":"assert is_integer(guess), \"Ensure `guess` is an integer\"\nassert is_integer(answer), \"Ensure `answer` is an integer\"\nassert is_binary(correct), \"Ensure `correct` is a string\"\n\ncond do\n  guess == answer -> assert correct == \"Correct!\"\n  guess < answer -> assert correct == \"Too low!\"\n  guess > answer -> assert correct == \"Too high!\"\nend","code":"guess = nil\r\nanswer = nil\r\n\r\ncorrect = nil","solution":"correct =\n  cond do\n    guess == answer -> \"Correct!\"\n    guess < answer -> \"Too low!\"\n    guess > answer -> \"Too high!\"\n  end"},"kind":"Elixir.TestedCell","livebook_object":"smart_cell"} -->

```elixir
ExUnit.start(auto_run: false)

defmodule Assertion do
  use ExUnit.Case

  test "" do
    guess = nil
    answer = nil

    correct = nil
    assert is_integer(guess), "Ensure `guess` is an integer"
    assert is_integer(answer), "Ensure `answer` is an integer"
    assert is_binary(correct), "Ensure `correct` is a string"

    cond do
      guess == answer -> assert correct == "Correct!"
      guess < answer -> assert correct == "Too low!"
      guess > answer -> assert correct == "Too high!"
    end
  end
end

ExUnit.run()

# Make variables and modules defined in the test available.
# Also allows for exploration using the output of the cell.
guess = nil
answer = nil

correct = nil
