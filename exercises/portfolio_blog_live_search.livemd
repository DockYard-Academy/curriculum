## Blog Page

From the [Portfolio: Blog Search](./portfolio_blog_search.livemd) exercise, you should already have the ability to search for blogs when the client visits http://localhost:4000/blog?title=search_string.

Using LiveView, you're going to add a realtime blog search. Now, the list of blogs will update every time the user types into the search text input without needing to press a submit button.

Test and implement a LiveView on a new http://localhost:4000/blog_live route rather than replacing the existing http://localhost:4000/blog route to avoid deleting your existing work.

### Blog Live

The Blog LiveView should display a list of all blogs when the user visits http://localhost:4000/blog_live.

There should be a text input that triggers a `phx-change` event to filter the list of blogs using the value of the text input.

Consider including the following test cases.

* Visit http://localhost:4000/blog_live and assert all blogs are found on the page.
* Visit http://localhost:4000/blog_live and trigger the search event. Assert all matching blogs are found on the page, and non-matching blogs are not found.
