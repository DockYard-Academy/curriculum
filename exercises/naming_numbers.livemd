## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Naming Numbers

In the Elixir cell below, create a function `naming_numbers` which accepts a
single digit integer and returns its string representation. So `1` would become `"one"`.

   0 --> zero
   1 --> one
   2 --> two
   3 --> three
   4 --> four
   5 --> five
   6 --> six
   7 --> seven
   8 --> eight
   9 --> nine
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
naming_numbers.(1)
"one"
```

  <summary>Solution Example</summary>

  ```elixir
  naming_numbers = fn integer ->
    case integer do
      0 -> "zero"
      1 -> "one"
      2 -> "two"
      3 -> "three"
      4 -> "four"
      5 -> "five"
      6 -> "six"
      7 -> "seven"
      8 -> "eight"
      9 -> "nine"
    end
  end
  ```
</details>

Enter your solution below.

## Numbering Names

In the Elixir cell below, create a function `numbering_names` which accepts a
number's name and returns its string representation. So `"one"` would become `1`.

In addition to accepting lowercase name, also accept uppercase names so `"One"` would become `1`.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart
  zero --> 0
  one --> 1
  two --> 2
  three --> 3
  four --> 4
  five --> 5
  six --> 6
  seven --> 7
  eight --> 8
  nine --> 9
```

```mermaid
flowchart
  Zero --> 0
  One --> 1
  Two --> 2
  Three --> 3
  Four --> 4
  Five --> 5
  Six --> 6
  Seven --> 7
  Eight --> 8
  Nine --> 9
```

  We can brute force the solutione using case.

  ```elixir
  numbering_names = fn int_str ->
    case int_str do
      "zero" -> 0
      "one" -> 1
      "two" -> 2
      "three" -> 3
      "four" -> 4
      "five" -> 5
      "six" -> 6
      "seven" -> 7
      "eight" -> 8
      "nine" -> 9
      "Zero" -> 0
      "One" -> 1
      "Two" -> 2
      "Three" -> 3
      "Four" -> 4
      "Five" -> 5
      "Six" -> 6
      "Seven" -> 7
      "Eight" -> 8
      "Nine" -> 9
    end
  end
  ```

  Or use [String.downcase/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#downcase/2) to make the solutione more concise.
  This has the added benefit of handling mixed case such as `"ZeRO"`.

  ```elixir
  numbering_names = fn int_str ->
    case String.downcase(int_str) do
      "zero" -> 0
      "one" -> 1
      "two" -> 2
      "three" -> 3
      "four" -> 4
      "five" -> 5
      "six" -> 6
      "seven" -> 7
      "eight" -> 8
      "nine" -> 9
    end
  end
  ```
