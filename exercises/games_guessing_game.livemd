## Games: Guessing Game

In your existing [Games](./games_setup.livemd) project, you're going to create a number guessing game which accepts user input through the
command line.

You should be able to start your project by running the following from the `game` folder in
the command line.

```
iex -S mix
```

Then you can start the game with the `Games.GuessingGame` module.

`Games.GuessingGame` should prompt the user to guess a number between `1` and `10`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
iex> Games.GuessingGame.start()
Enter your guess: 10
```

If the guess is correct, return a winning message.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Enter your guess: 10
Correct!
```

if the guess is incorrect, return a failing message.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Enter your guess: 10
Incorrect!
```

### Bonus: Re-Attempt

If the guess is incorrect, re-prompt the user to enter another guess until they succeed.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Enter your guess: 10
Incorrect!
Enter your guess: 5
Incorrect!
Enter your guess: 7
Correct!
```

### Bonus: High Or Low!

If the guess is too high or low, prompt the user with informative feedback.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Enter your guess: 10
Too High!
Enter your guess: 5
Too Low!
Enter your guess: 7
Correct!
```
