## Blog Comments

You're going to add a the ability to comment on a blog to your existing portfolio project.

* Comments **belong to** a Blog.
* Blogs **have many** Comments.

Comments should have `:user_id`, `:content`, and `:blog_id` fields.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Comment {
    blog_id: :id
    content: :text
  }
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Comment Requirements

Ensure you:

* Can create an associated comment from the blog show page using a form with a textarea input.
* List all associated comments on the blog show page.

You do not need to handle commenting on a comment. All comments will be for the associated blog.

### Bonus: Usernames

Add a new `:username` field to each user if you have not already from a previous exercise.
Associate comments with the currently signed in user, and display the User's `:username` above each comment.

This creates a new relationship between Comments and Users, but does not change the relationship between Comments and Blogs.

* Users **have many** Comments.
* Comments **belong to** a User.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class User {
    username: :text
  }
  class Comment {
    user_id: :id
  }
```

Ensure you:

* Display the username of the user associated with each comment on the blog show page, in the list of comments.
