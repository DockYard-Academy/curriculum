## Capstone Project

The capstone project is the final project for the DockYard Academy Course. This project is an opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge you have learned throughout this course to a real-world problem of your choosing.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Requirements

Your capstone project should incorporate the following features:

* Use Phoenix LiveView and PubSub to build a real-time distributed feature.
* Use Ecto to connect to a database and manage one or more associations (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
* Interact with an external API, library, or service.
* Use authentication to authorize users.

If you have a project idea that deviates from these requirements but still adequately demonstrates what you have learned in this course, then speak with your instructor to request approval.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Presentation

Students will present their capstone project publicly to the Elixir community. During your presentation, we recommend you:

* Summarize the technologies (languages, frameworks, APIs, services, etc.) used in the project.
* Demonstrate the main features of your project.
* Share a particularly challenging or compelling piece of code.
* Any features you would like to add to the project if you were to expand it after the academy.

You will have ten minutes to present your project and five minutes to answer audience questions. Consider timing yourself and practice your transitions from feature to feature to prepare.

## Commit Your Progress

DockYard Academy now recommends you use the latest [Release](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/curriculum/releases) rather than forking or cloning our repository.

Run `git status` to ensure there are no undesirable changes.
Then run the following in your command line from the `curriculum` folder to commit your progress.

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish Capstone Project Guide reading"
$ git push
```

We're proud to offer our open-source curriculum free of charge for anyone to learn from at their own pace.

We also offer a paid course where you can learn from an instructor alongside a cohort of your peers.
We will accept applications for the June-August 2023 cohort soon.
