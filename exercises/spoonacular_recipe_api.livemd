## Spoonacular Recipe API

[Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/) is a popular food API.

Create a free Spoonacular to get your API key. You can view your API key in the [Spoonacular Console](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard).

### Browser Request

Use your API to visit the `https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch?apiKey=API_KEY` URL where API_KEY should be your API key from the console.

### HTTPoison Request

Use [HTTPoison](https://hexdocs.pm/httpoison/HTTPoison.html) to retrieve the same JSON data from the `https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch?apiKey=API_KEY` URL you visited in the browser. Then use [Poison](https://hexdocs.pm/poison/Poison.html) to decode the JSON response into an Elixir data structure.

```elixir

```
