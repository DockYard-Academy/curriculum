## File Types

Create a `FileTypes` module which can display the number of files of a given type in a folder.

For example, we have create a `file_types` folder with several files inside of it.

```elixir
File.ls!("data/file_types")
```

Provided a folder, your `FileTypes` module should return the number of files by their extension.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
[txt: 2, ex: 2, png: 1, jpg: 1] = FileTypes.find("data/file_types")
```

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
defmodule FileTypes do
  def find(folder) do
  end
end
```
