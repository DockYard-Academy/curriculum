## Dominoe

[Dominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes) are square tiles often placed near each other to make satisfying effects when it falls and knocks each other over.

We've created a named `Domino` process that can receive a generic `:fall` message to cause it to crash. It will also print a message every time it's started with the name of the process.

```elixir
defmodule Domino do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(opts) do
    IO.inspect(opts, label: "STARTED DOMINO")
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: opts[:name])
  end

  @impl true
  def init(opts) do
    {:ok, opts}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_info(:fall, _state) do
    raise "error"
  end
end
```

You're going to start three `Domino` processes under a supervisor. When one crashes, they should restart sequentially in the order they are defined.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart TD 
    Supervisor
    Supervisor --> Domino1
    Supervisor --> Domino2
    Supervisor --> Domino3

    classDef crashed fill:#fe8888;
    classDef terminated fill:#fbab04;
    classDef restarted stroke:#0cac08,stroke-width:4px

    class Domino2 crashed
    class Domino3 terminated
    class Domino2,Domino3 restarted
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

For example, if `Domino2` crashes, then `Domino3` should also be restarted. If `Domino3` crashes, no other processes are affected.

Use the <code>:rest_for_one</code> strategy for your supervisor.

<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
children = [
  %{
    id: :domino1,
    start: {Domino, :start_link, [[name: :domino1]]}
  },
  %{
    id: :domino2,
    start: {Domino, :start_link, [[name: :domino2]]}
  },
  %{
    id: :domino3,
    start: {Domino, :start_link, [[name: :domino3]]}
  }
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :rest_for_one)
```

</details>

Keep in mind, if you have already started a named process, the supervisor might crash when you attempt to start it again. Re-evaluate the cell after the livebook crashes to resolve this issue.

```elixir

```

Send your dominos messages to ensure they are crashing in the correct order. They will log a message that demonstrates the `Domino.start_link/1` function was called again.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example Solution</summary>

Replace `:domino_name` with the name of a domino process you started in the supervisor above.

```elixir
Process.send(:domino_name, :fall, [])
```

</details>

Test sending each `Domino` process a message individually.

```elixir

```
