## Phone Parsing

You have been provided a `phone_numbers` text file with all phone numbers between `555-555-0100`
and `555-555-0199`.

```
555-555-0100
555-555-0101
555-555-0102
555-555-0103
... and so on.
```

The following code creates the file.

```elixir
file_content =
  for int <- 100..199, into: "" do
    "555-555-0#{int}\n"
  end

File.write("data/phone_numbers.txt", file_content)
```

You are going to read the content from the file, and convert it into a list of integers.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
PhoneNumbers.get()
[5555550100, 5555550101, 5555550102, ...] # and so on.
```

While not strictly necessary for a file of this size, consider using [File.stream!/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#stream!/1) or [File.open/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#open/1) so that you do not need to load the entire file
into memory.

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
defmodule PhoneNumbers do
  def get do
  end
end

# The following should return a list of the correct phone number integers.
PhoneNumbers.get()
```
