## Measurements

You are going to make a utility module for working with measurements.
This exercise was inspired by [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/), which is a fantastic resource for learning about Elixir through practical problems.

<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
defmodule Measurements do
  def increments(measurements) do
    measurements
    |> Enum.chunk_every(2, 1, :discard)
    |> Enum.map(fn [x, y] -> y - x end)
  end

  def increased(measurements) do
    measurements
    |> increments()
    |> Enum.count(&(&1 > 0))
  end

  def increased_by(measurements) do
    measurements
    |> increments()
    |> Enum.filter(&(&1 > 0))
    |> Enum.sum()
  end

  def average(measurements) do
    Enum.sum(measurements) / Enum.count(measurements)
  end
end
```

Implement the `Measurements` module according to the documented function examples.

```elixir
defmodule Measurements do
  @doc """
  Given a list of measurements as integers, determine how many have increased.
  Each positive change since the previous integer in the list should count as an increase.

  ## Examples

    iex> Measurements.increased([1, 1, 2, 3, 1])
    2

    iex> Measurements.increased([1, 2, 1])
    1

    iex> Measurements.increased([3, 1, 2])
    1
  """
  def increased(measurements) do
  end

  @doc """
  Given a list of measurements as integers, determine the increment between each integer.

  ## Examples

    iex> Measurements.increments([100, 150, 120, 130])
    [50, -30, 10]

    iex> Measurements.increments([10, 20, 10, 40])
    [10, -10, 30]
  """
  def increments(measurements) do
  end

  @doc """
  Given a list of measurements as integers, sum the amount they have increased by.
  Only positive increments are taken into account.

  ## Examples

    iex> Measurements.increased_by([100, 150, 120, 130])
    60

    iex> Measurements.increased_by([10, 20, 10, 40])
    40
  """
  def increased_by(measurements) do
  end

  @doc """
  Find the average of a list of numbers.
  You can calculate average as sum of integers / length of list.

  ## Examples

    iex> Measurements.average([4, 5, 6])
    5

    iex> Measurements.average([2, 10])
    6
  """
  def average(measurements) do
  end
end
```
