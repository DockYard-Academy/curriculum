## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Review Questions

Upon completing this lesson, a student should be able to answer the following questions.

* What are strings, and what kind of information are they useful for storing?
* How do we add two strings together using string concatenation?
* How do we interpret Elixir code inside of a string using string interpolation?

## Strings

A string is any sequence of characters contained within two double quotes `""`.
A character is any single number, letter, or symbol.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
"T" # letters
"t" # letters
"1" # numbers
"1.2" # numbers
"&" # symbols
"_" # symbols
```

You can visualize a string as characters joined together by strings.
Strings can be a single character, no characters, or many characters!

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S --- T --- R --- I --- N --- G
```

Strings can contain single quotes and other symbols such as `!@#$%^&*()_+-=';:` and more.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
"!@#$%^&*()_+-=';:"
```

They are useful for representing all kinds of information as text.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, create a string `"Hello, world!"`. This is a rite of passage for every
programmer.

```elixir

```

## Multiline Strings

Sometimes we want to represent a string with multiple lines. The newline `\n` character represents a new line in a string.

```elixir
string = "line 1\nline 2\nline 3"

IO.puts(string)
```

To make defining multiline strings easier, Elixir allows us to use three quotes `"""` to define a multiline string.

```elixir
string = """
line 1
line 1
line 1
"""

IO.puts(string)
```

## String Operators

String operators allow us to manipulate strings.

The `<>` operator joins two strings together. Joining strings together is called **string concatenation**.

```elixir
"hello, " <> "world."
```

Only strings can be concatenated together using the `<>` operator. You'll notice concatenating `1` causes an error `expected binary argument in <> operator but got 1`
This error occurs because we're asking the computer to concatenate a string with an integer.

```elixir
"hello" <> 1
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, use string concatenation to join `"Hi "` and the name of one
of your classmates.

So `"Peter"` would be come `"Hi Peter."`.

Replace `nil` with your answer.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
"Hi " <> "Peter."
```

</details>

```elixir

```

### String Interpolation

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Using `#{}`, We can also **interpolate** values in strings. Essentially, this means we can evaluate code inside of
a string. The code you want to interpolate inside of the string
goes between the curly braces `{}`.

So we can evaluate `4 + 4`, which equals `8` inside a string.

```elixir
"I have #{4 + 4} apples."
```

String interpolation is often useful when your string has many computed values or tricky punctuation.
Otherwise, it's easy to make mistakes.

Notice that there's a grammar mistake below that could easily be missed when using string concatenation.

```elixir
"I have" <> "8" <> "apples"
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, use **string interpolation** to say `I have #{X - 1} classmates.`. Where X is the number of people in your cohort including yourself.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
"I have #{1 - 1} classmates."
```

</details>

```elixir
answer = nil
```

## Escaping Characters

Elixir allows you to use [Escape Characters](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/String.html#module-escape-characters) to represent special values in a string. We've already seen the `\n` escape character for a newline.

For example, we can use the `\` symbol to escape special characters in a string. This is handy when you want to include characters that would have alternative meaning in the string. For example, if you wanted to include double quotes in a string, you can escape the double quote `\"`.

```elixir
string = "They said \"so this is how you include double quotes in a string!\""

IO.puts(string)
```

There are other special characters such as backslashes `\`, or interpolation syntax that you might want to escape.

```elixir
string = "Use \#\{\} to interpolate a value in a string"

IO.puts(string)
```

```elixir
string = "If you don't escape using backslash \\, then #{} doesn't appear"

IO.puts(string)
```
