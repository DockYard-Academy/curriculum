## Measurements

You are going to make a utility module for working with measurements.

### increased/1

Given a list of measurements as integers, determine how many have increased.
Each positive change since the previous integer in the list should count as an increase.

For example:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Measurements.increased([1, 1, 2, 3, 1])
2

Measurements.increased([1, 2, 1])
1

Measurements.increased([3, 1, 2])
1
```

### increased_by/1

Given a list of measurements as integers, sum the amount they have increased by.

For example:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Measurements.increased_by([100, 150, 120, 130])
60

Measurements.increased_by([10, 20, 10, 40])
40
```

### increments/1

Given a list of measurements as integers, determine the increment between each integer.

For example:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Measurements.increments([100, 150, 120, 130])
[50, -30, 10]

Measurements.increments([10, 20, 10, 40])
[10, -10, 30]
```

### average/1

Find the average of a list of numbers. You can calculate average as $\frac{sum}{length}$.

For example:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Measurements.average([4, 5, 6])
5

Measurements.average([2, 10])
6
```
