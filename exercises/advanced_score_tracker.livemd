## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Mastery

Mastery assignments are bonus projects designed to incorporate curriculum concepts at an advanced level. You have complete freedom with how you complete mastery assignments, and may change requirements as you see fit. Each mastery assignment serves as an independent project you may choose to include on your portfolio of projects.

## Advanced Score Tracker

Create a new supervised mix project `AdvancedScoreTracker`.

```
$ mix new advanced_score_tracker --sup
```

The `AdvancedScoreTracker` will use an [Agent](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Agent.html) to create a general purpose score tracker that tracks player score history across multiple different games. The `AdvancedScoreTracker` [Agent](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Agent.html) should start as part of the application's supervision tree.

<summary>Hint</summary>

Consider how you want to store your state, and how to update it.
For example, you might consider a map.

```elixir
state = %{
  player1: %{
    ping_pong: [0, 20]
  },
  player2: %{
    ping_pong: [0, 20]
    rock_paper_scissors: [3, 2]
  }
}
```

### Test Cases

Create a full suite of test cases for all of the features described below.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Score

The `AdvancedScoreTracker` should be able to add a certain number of points given a player name and a game name. A game should start with `0` points by default.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
AdvancedScoreTracker.add(:player1, :ping_pong, 10)
AdvancedScoreTracker.add(:player1, :ping_pong, 10)
```

It should also be able to retrieve the total number of points for the current game when provided the name of the game and the player.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
20 = AdvancedScoreTracker.get(:player1, :ping_pong)
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### New Game

When a game is finished, `AdvancedScoreTracker` should be able to start a new point total with a default score of `0`.
The previous game total should be saved, see the **History** section below.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
AdvancedScoreTracker.new(:player1, :ping_pong)
0 = AdvancedScoreTracker.get(:player1, :ping_pong)
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### History

Retrieve a history of scores for a player and a game as a list of point totals.
The most recent game should be at the start of the list.

Each value should be the total number of points accumulated before calling `AdvancedScoreTracker.new/2` to start a new game.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
[0, 20] = AdvancedScoreTracker.history(:player1, :ping_pong)
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### High Score

Find a player's highest score from their history.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
20 = AdvancedScoreTracker.high_score(:player1, :ping_pong)
```

Find the highest score out of all players for a game.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
20 = AdvancedScoreTracker.high_score(:ping_pong)
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Create A GitHub Repository

Connect your `AdvancedScoreTracker` project to a GitHub repository and create a README to describe the purpose of the project and what you learned building it.
