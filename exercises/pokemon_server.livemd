## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Overview

You're going to create a pokemon battle game with persistence.

Each Pokemon will be a [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html) process storing the pokemon's stats in state.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
classDiagram
 class Pokemon {
  health: 20
  attack: 5
  type: :fire
  name: "charmander"
 }
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Pokemon can attack each other. An attack should update the `Pokemon`'s health in the [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html)'s state.

## Create Pokemon Server

Create a `Pokemon` module which will be a [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html) and a struct definition. It should store the following in values in state. You do not need to validate these values, you can assume each will be the following:

* `:name` will be a string.
* `:type` will be an atom of either `:grass`, `:water`, or `:fire`
* `:health` will be an integer with a default value of `20`
* `:attack` will be an integer with a default value of `5`

You should be able to create a `Pokemon` struct.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
%Pokemon{name: "Charmander", type: :fire, health: 20, attack: 5}
```

`Pokemon` [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html)s should be able to attack one another. This should subtract one pokemon's `:attack` from the other pokemon's `:health`, and update the value in the state of the [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html). A pokemon's health should not be able to fall below `0`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
attacker = Pokemon.start_link(pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur1", type: :grass})
defender = Pokemon.start_link(pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur2", type: :grass})

Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
%Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur1", type: :grass, health: 15, attack: 20}
```

### Type Advantages and Weaknesses

Multiply the damage dealt by an attack by `2` if the attacker has a type advantage. Multiply the damage applied by `0.5` if the attacker has a type weakness.

Type Advantages are:

* fire -> grass
* grass -> water
* water -> fire

Type weaknesses are:

* fire -> water
* grass -> fire
* water -> grass

  <summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
defmodule Pokemon do
  use GenServer
  @enforce_keys [:name, :type]
  defstruct @enforce_keys ++ [health: 20, attack: 5]

  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    {pokemon, opts} = Keyword.pop!(opts, :pokemon)
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, pokemon, opts)
  end

  @impl true
  def init(state) do
    {:ok, state}
  end

  def attack(attacker, defender) do
    attacker_type = Pokemon.get(attacker, :type)
    defender_type = Pokemon.get(defender, :type)
    damage_amount = Pokemon.get(attacker, :attack) * multiplier(attacker_type, defender_type)
    GenServer.call(defender, {:apply_damage, damage_amount})
  end

  def multiplier(attacker_type, defender_type) do
    case {attacker_type, defender_type} do
      {:fire, :grass} -> 2
      {:grass, :water} -> 2
      {:water, :fire} -> 2
      {:fire, :water} -> 0.5
      {:grass, :fire} -> 0.5
      {:water, :grass} -> 0.5
      _ -> 1
    end
  end

  def get(pokemon, key) do
    GenServer.call(pokemon, {:get, key})
  end

  def handle_call({:get, key}, _from, pokemon) do
    {:reply, Map.get(pokemon, key), pokemon}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call({:apply_damage, amount}, _from, pokemon) do
    updated_pokemon = Map.update!(pokemon, :health, fn health -> max(health - amount, 0) end)
    {:reply, updated_pokemon, updated_pokemon}
  end
end
```

</details>

Implement the `Pokemon` GenServer and struct definition as documented below.

```elixir
defmodule Pokemon do
  @moduledoc """
  Pokemon Server

  Defines a Pokemon GenServer and struct.

  ## Examples

    iex> %Pokemon{name: "Charmander", type: :fire}
    %Pokemon{name: "Charmander", type: :fire, health: 20, attack: 5}
  """
  use GenServer

  @doc """
  Start the Pokemon GenServer.

  ## Examples
      iex> {:ok, pokemon} = Pokemon.start_link([pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Charmander", type: :fire}])
  """
  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
  end

  @doc """
  Apply the attacker's attack damage to the defender's health.

  ## Examples

    With default values.
      iex> {:ok, attacker} = Pokemon.start_link(pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur1", type: :grass})
      iex> {:ok, defender} = Pokemon.start_link(pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur2", type: :grass})
      iex> Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
      %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur2", type: :grass, health: 15, attack: 5}
      iex> Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
      %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur2", type: :grass, health: 10, attack: 5}
      iex> Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
      %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur2", type: :grass, health: 5, attack: 5}
      iex> Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
      %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur2", type: :grass, health: 0, attack: 5}
      iex> Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
      %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur2", type: :grass, health: 0, attack: 5}

    With type advantage

      iex> {:ok, attacker} = Pokemon.start_link(pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Charmander", type: :fire})
      iex> {:ok, defender} = Pokemon.start_link(pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur", type: :grass})
      iex> Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
      %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur", type: :grass, health: 10, attack: 5}

    With type weakness

      iex> {:ok, attacker} = Pokemon.start_link(pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur", type: :grass})
      iex> {:ok, defender} = Pokemon.start_link(pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Charmander", type: :fire})
      iex> Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
      %Pokemon{name: "Charmander", type: :fire, health: 17.5, attack: 5}

    Ensure you use the attacking pokemon's attack number to apply damage to the defending pokemon's health.

      iex> {:ok, attacker} = Pokemon.start_link(pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur1", type: :grass, attack: 20})
      iex> {:ok, defender} = Pokemon.start_link(pokemon: %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur2", type: :grass, health: 45})
      iex> Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
      %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur2", type: :grass, health: 25, attack: 5}
  """
  def attack(attacker, defender) do
  end
end
