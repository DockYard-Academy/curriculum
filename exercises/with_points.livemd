## With Points

You're going to create a `Points` module which determines the total score of each team in a generic game after three rounds.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
game = %{
  team1_name: "Team Team",
  team2_name: "Exersport",
  round1: %{
    team1: 10,
    team2: 20
  },
  round2: %{
    team1: 30,
    team2: 10
  },
  round3: %{
    team1: 25,
    team2: 30
  }
}

Points.tally(game)
%{"Team Team" => 65, "Exersport" => 60}
```

Use `with` to ensure the following:

* If the `game` provided does not have a `:team1_name` or `team2_name` keys return `{:error, :invalid}`.
* If the `game` does not have a `round1`, `round2`, or `round3` key, each with `:team1` and `:team2` keys return `{:error, :invalid}`.

<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
defmodule Points do
  def tally(game) do
    with %{team1_name: team1, team2_name: team2} <- game,
         %{round1: %{team1: t1r1, team2: t2r1}} <- game,
         %{round2: %{team1: t1r2, team2: t2r2}} <- game,
         %{round3: %{team1: t1r3, team2: t2r3}} <- game do
      %{}
      |> Map.put(team1, t1r1 + t1r2 + t1r3)
      |> Map.put(team2, t2r1 + t2r2 + t2r3)
    else
      error -> 
        IO.inspect(error)
        {:error, :invalid}
    end
  end
end
```

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
defmodule Points do
  @doc """
  Tally points in a generic three round game.

  A valid game will return the teams and their total scores in a map.

      iex> game = %{team1_name: "Team Team", team2_name: "Exersport", round1: %{team1: 10, team2: 20}, round2: %{team1: 30, team2: 10}, round3: %{team1: 25, team2: 30}}
      iex> Points.tally(game)
      %{"Team Team" => 65, "Exersport" => 60}

  The `game` must have a `team1_name` and `team2_name` keys.

      iex> Points.tally(%{no_team_names: true})
      {:error, :invalid}

  The `game` must have a `round1`, `round2`, and `round3` keys.

      iex> Points.tally(%{team1_name: "name1", team2_name: "name2"})
      {:error, :invalid}
  """
  def tally(game) do
    with %{team1_name: team1, team2_name: team2} <- game,
         %{round1: %{team1: t1r1, team2: t2r1}} <- game,
         %{round2: %{team1: t1r2, team2: t2r2}} <- game,
         %{round3: %{team1: t1r3, team2: t2r3}} <- game do
      %{}

      error ->
