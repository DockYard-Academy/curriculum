## Games: Benchmarking

In your existing [Games](./games_setup.livemd) project, you're going to benchmark your [Wordle](./games_wordle.livemd) application.

First, add [Benchee](https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee) to your existing list of dependencies.

You're going to run benchmarks in your ExUnit test suite. Since benchmarks are usually expensive, you'll create a custom `:benchmark` tag and
exclude this tag from tests in `test_helper.exs`.

You should be able to run benchmarks using the `--only=benchmark` or the `--include=benchmark` flag.

```
mix test --only=benchmark
```

Benchmark the `Games.Wordle.feedback/2` function you previously created. Refactor your solution and try to optimize its performance.

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the curriculum folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.
Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-games_benchmarking
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish games benchmarking exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-games_benchmarking
```
