## Concurrent Word Count

Given a list of documents, use the [Task](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html) module to concurrently find the total word count of every document combined.

For our purposes, a **word** will be any sequence of characters separated by a space. You do not have to handle invalid words, punctuation, or other special cases.

```elixir
document = """
This is my document document
"""

String.split(document, " ", trim: true)
```

<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
defmodule WordCount do
  def individual_count(documents) do
    tasks =
      Enum.map(documents, fn document ->
        Task.async(fn ->
          document |> String.split(" ", trim: true) |> Enum.count()
        end)
      end)

    Task.await_many(tasks)
  end

  def total_count(documents) do
    documents |> individual_count() |> Enum.sum()
  end
end
```

</details>

Implement the `WordCount` module as documented below.

```elixir
defmodule WordCount do
  @moduledoc """
  Documentation for `WordCount`.
  """

  @doc """
  Concurrently count the number of words in each document.

  ## Examples

      iex> WordCount.individual_count(["document one", "document two"])
      [2, 2]
  """
  def individual_count(documents) do
  end

  @doc """
  Concurrently count the number of words in each document and return
  the combined count.

  iex> WordCount.total_count(["document one", "document two"])
  4
  """
  def total_count(documents) do
  end
end
```
