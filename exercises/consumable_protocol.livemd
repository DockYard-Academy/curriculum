## Overview

You're creating a (RPG) Role Playing Game where there are `Character` structs which store information about a character.

Define a `Character` struct with the following keys and default values.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Character {
        strength: 10
        dexterity: 10
        constitution: 10
        wisdom: 10
        intelligence: 10
        charisma: 10
    }
```

<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
defmodule Character do
  defstruct [strength: 10, dexterity: 10, constitution: 10, wisdom: 10, intelligence: 10, charisma: 10]
end
```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir

```

Our game has `Consumable` items when modify a character's base stats. For example, we'll have
a `StrengthPotion` struct which will increase a `Character`'s strength based on the `:level` key.

Define item structs with the following keys and default values.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class StrengthPotion {
      level: 1
    }
    class DexterityPotion {
      level: 1
    }
    class ConstitutionPotion {
      level: 1
    }
    class WisdomPotion {
      level: 1
    }
    class IntelligencePotion {
      level: 1
    }
    class CharismaPotion {
      level: 1
    }
```

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
defmodule StrengthPotion do
  defstruct [level: 1]
end

defmodule DexterityPotion do
  defstruct [level: 1]
end

defmodule ConstitutionPotion do
  defstruct [level: 1]
end

defmodule WisdomPotion do
  defstruct [level: 1]
end

defmodule IntelligencePotion do
  defstruct [level: 1]
end

defmodule CharismaPotion do
  defstruct [level: 1]
end
```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
Enum.map("abc", fn char -> char end)
```

To make our system extendable, we'll have a `Consumable` protocol, and separate implementations for structs such as the `StrengthPotion`.

Create a `Consumable` protocol with a `consume/2` function which accepts an item and a `Character` struct. We'll apply the items affects and return a newly updated character.

Also create `Consumable` implementations for the `StrengthPotion`, `DexterityPotion`, `ConstitutionPotion`, `WisdomPotion`, `IntelligencePotion`, and `CharismaPotion` structs.

When consumed, the item should increase the associated `Character` struct key by the `:level` of the `Consumable` item.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Consumable.consume(%StrengthPotion{level: 1}, %Character{})
%Character{strength: 11, dexterity: 10, consititution: 10, wisdom: 10, intelligence: 10, charisma: 10}

Consumable.consume(%DexterityPotion{level: 2}, %Character{})
%Character{strength: 10, dexterity: 12, consititution: 10, wisdom: 10, intelligence: 10, charisma: 10}
```

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
defprotocol Consumable do
  def consume(item, character)
end

defimpl Consumable, for: StrengthPotion do
  def consume(potion, character) do
    %{character | strength: character.strength + potion.level}
  end
end

defimpl Consumable, for: DexterityPotion do
  def consume(potion, character) do
    %{character | dexterity: character.dexterity + potion.level}
  end
end

defimpl Consumable, for: ConstitutionPotion do
  def consume(potion, character) do
    %{character | constitution: character.constitution + potion.level}
  end
end

defimpl Consumable, for: WisdomPotion do
  def consume(potion, character) do
    %{character | wisdom: character.wisdom + potion.level}
  end
end

defimpl Consumable, for: IntelligencePotion do
  def consume(potion, character) do
    %{character | intelligence: character.intelligence + potion.level}
  end
end

defimpl Consumable, for: CharismaPotion do
  def consume(potion, character) do
    %{character | charisma: character.charisma + potion.level}
  end
end
