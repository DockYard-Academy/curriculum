# DockYard Academy

The DockYard Academy curriculum is an open source Elixir curriculum built with Livebook.
We're proud to offer our open-source curriculum free of charge for anyone to learn from at their own pace.

We also offer a paid course where you can learn from an instructor alongside a cohort of your peers. Applications will be accepted soon.

Email the instructor Brooklin at brooklin.myers@dockyard.com or direct message [@BrooklinJMyers](https://twitter.com/BrooklinJMyers) on Twitter if you would like more information.

## Prerequisites
* Install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
