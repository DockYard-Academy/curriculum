## Blog Page

You're going to add a blog to your existing portfolio project.

Blogs should have a title, subtitle, and content.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Blog {
    title: :string
    subtitle: :string
    content: :text
  }
```

### Blog Requirements

Ensure you:

* Add the full matrix of HTTP actions under the `"/blog"` route using either `resources/4` or individual `get/4`, `post/4` and `put/4` macros.
* Create a controller with the corresponding `:index`, `:edit`, `:show`, `:new`, `:create`, `:update`, and `:delete` actions.
* Create a view and templates for the `:index`
* Create a context.
* Create a schema for the blog post with at least the `:title`, `:subtitle`, and `:content` fields.
* Create a migration to create a blog posts table.

Also ensure that you do not break any existing functionality. You should still
be able to visit the home page on http://localhost:4000.

Outside of these requirements you may stretch your creativity. Consider spending any additional time you may have on improving the styles for the project.

You may find the `mix phx.gen.html` command useful for this exercise.

### Navigation

Add navigation links on both the blog and home page.

Consider adding this navigation in `lib/portfolio_web/templates/layout/root.html.heex` to have the same navigation on every page and avoid duplicating code.

The navigation should include a link to the `"/"` route to view the home page, and the `"/blog"` route to view the blog page. Consider using [Path Helpers](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/routing.html#path-helpers) instead of static routes.
