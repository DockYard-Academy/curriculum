## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Named Number Lists

Generate a list with ten random integers from `0` to `9`. Convert each integer in this list to it's string representation so `1` would become `"one"`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
# input
[1, 2, 4, 2, 7, 8, 0, 4, 5, 6]
# output
["one", "two", "four", "two", "seven", "eight", "zero", "four", "five", "six"]
```

   0 --> zero

   8 --> eight
   9 --> nine

  <summary>Example Solution</summary>

  ```elixir
  random_integers = Enum.map(1..10, fn _ -> Enum.random(0..9) end)

  Enum.map(random_integers, fn integer ->
    case integer do
      0 -> "zero"
      1 -> "one"
      2 -> "two"
      3 -> "three"
      4 -> "four"
      5 -> "five"
      6 -> "six"
      7 -> "seven"
      8 -> "eight"
      9 -> "nine"
    end
  end)
  ```
