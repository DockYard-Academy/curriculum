## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively, you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Review Questions

Upon completing this lesson, a student should be able to answer the following questions.

* What is a tuple and how do you create one?
* How do you pattern match on a tuple to bind elements in the tuple to variables?

## Tuples

Tuples are fixed size containers for multiple elements.
Like lists they can contain any data type.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
{}
{7}
{1, 2, 3}
{"example"}
{1, "pizza", 3, :success, false}
```

They are often used when you know the number of desired elements and their type.
For example, it's common in Elixir to use tuples to represent failure or success cases
with the associated error message or success value.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
{:success, "Well done!"}
{:error, "Too bad!"}
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, create a tuple with `:ok` as the first element, and `"got it!"` as
the second element.

## Pattern Matching

In Elixir, the `=` sign is the match operator. In other programming languages, you may call it the assignment operator.

Elixir calls `=` the match operator because it uses pattern matching to bind variables.

What is pattern matching? Well rather than simply assigning values to variables, Elixir allows
you to bind variables on the left-hand side of the `=`. So long as it matches the same shape of the right hand side of the `=`.

For example, the following expression is the most "strict" match possible. Both sides are exactly equal.

```elixir
{1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}
```

The `=` operator attempts to coerce the left side value to match the right side value, so when we write the following expression, we bind `my_tuple` to `{1, 2, 3}` in order to make the right and the left side match.

The coercion to match is less obvious with a simple variable name, because it's like a blank canvas, it can match any value.

```elixir
my_tuple = {1, 2, 3}
```

However, we can bind other values inside of a container data type, so the left and right side still match.

```elixir
{one, two, three} = {1, 2, 3}
```

Now we can use these bound variables `one`, `two`, and `three` in our program.

```elixir
one
```

```elixir
two
```

```elixir
three
```

So long as the expression on the left side of match operator `=` matches the pattern of the right side, you can bind variables to values.

The tuple with variables bound on the left side must have the same number of elements as the tuple on the right side, otherwise we'll cause a [MatchError](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/MatchError.html).

```elixir
{one, two} = {1, 2, 3}
```

If we want to bind some of the variables in a tuple, and ignore others, we can use an `_` to ignore any variables.

```elixir
{one, _two, three} = {1, 2, 3}
```

You can pattern match with any kind of data. So long as the left side matches the right side. We'll cover pattern matching with other data structures in later reading material.

### Your Turn

Use pattern matching to bind `"jewel"` to a variable called `jewel`.
Replace `jewel` with your answer.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
{_gold, _treasure, jewel} = {"gold", "treasure", "jewel"}
jewel
```

</details>

```elixir
{"gold", "treasure", "jewel"}
```
