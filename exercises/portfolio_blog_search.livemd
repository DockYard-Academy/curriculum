## Blog Page

You're going to add the ability to search for blogs posts to your portfolio project.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

The blog page should have a text input and a search button that directs the user to http://localhost:4000/blogs?title=input_string
where `search_string` is the text inside of the form.

http://localhost:4000/blogs?title=input_string should only display blogs whose title includes the `search_string` (case-insensitive).

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Blog Context

The blog context should be able to search for blogs by their title.
The exact interface depends on how you have implemented blogs. You might consider something like the following.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Blog.list_all(title: "My Title")
```

Which would return a list of blog structs that include the search string in their title (case insensitive).

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
[
  %Blog{id: 1, title: "My Title", content: "My Example Content"},
  %Blog{id: 3, title: "my title", content: "My Example Content"}
  %Blog{id: 3, title: "MY TITLE", content: "My Example Content"}
]
```

Filter out blogs that do not include the searched text in their title.
Blogs that include the text should be found.

Consider including the following test cases.

* Find blog(s) that exactly match search. (`"My Title"` matches `"My Title"`)
* Find blog(s) that partially match search. (`"My Title"` matches `"This Includes My Title In It"`)
* Find blog(s) that match search lower case insensitive. (`"My Title"` matches `"my title"`)
* Find blog(s) that match search capital case insensitive. (`"My Title"` matches `"MY TITLE"`)
* Do not find blogs that do not match search. (`"My Title"` does not match `"Non-matching Title"`)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Blog Controller

The blog controller should already display all blogs on the blog page when the client visits http://localhost:4000/blogs.

There should be a form with a text input and a submit button that triggers a GET request to http://localhost:4000/blogs?title=search_string where `search_string` is the value of the text input.

The blog controller should filter the list of blogs by the `title` query parameter when the client visits http://localhost:4000/blogs?title=search_string.

Consider including the following test cases.

* Visit http://localhost:4000/blogs and trigger form input with the text "MyTitle". Assert the client is redirected to http://localhost:4000/blogs?title=MyTitle.
* Visit http://localhost:4000/blogs?title=MyTitle and find matching blogs.
