## Process Drills

Drills help you develop familiarity and muscle memory with syntax through repeated exercises. Unlike usual problems, Drills are not intended to develop problem solving skills, they are purely for developing comfort and speed.

This set of drills is for the [Process](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html) module. Follow the instructions for each drill and complete them as quickly as you can.

## Process.send/3

Use [Process.send/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#send/3) and `self()` to send the process for the Elixir cell below a `:message` message. Use [receive](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#receive/1) to receive the message in the same cell.

```elixir

```

Use [Process.send/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#send/3) and `self()` to send the process for the Elixir cell below a message with a value i.e. `{:message, "value"}`. Use [receive](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#receive/1) to receive the message in the same cell and return the value.

```elixir

```

## Process.spawn/2

Use [Process.spawn/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#spawn/2) to spawn a new process which adds two integers together.

```elixir

```

Use [Process.spawn/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#spawn/2) and [Process.sleep/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#sleep/1) to spawn a process that sleeps for five seconds, then prints "Finished!".

```elixir

```

Use [Process.spawn/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#spawn/2) and [receive](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#receive/1) to spawn a process that receives a `:message` message. Use [Process.send/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#send/3) to send the spawned process a `:message` message. The spawned process should print `"received a message!"`.

```elixir

```

Use [Process.spawn/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#spawn/2) and [receive](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#receive/1) to spawn a process that receives a message with a value i.e. `{:message, "value"}`. Use [Process.send/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#send/3) to send the spawned process a message with a value. The spawned process should print the received value.

```elixir

```

Use [Process.spawn/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#spawn/2) to spawn a process that raises an error. Notice it does not crash the Livebook, because it is an **unlinked** process.

```elixir

```

Use [Process.spawn/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#spawn/3) and [Process.sleep/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#sleep/1) to spawn a process which raises an error after one second. Use [Process.link/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#link/1) to link the process.

Livebook should crash. Comment out your solution so that you can move on.

```elixir

```

## Process.alive?/1

Use [Process.spawn/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#spawn/2) and [Process.sleep/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#sleep/1) to spawn a process that sleeps for five seconds. Use [Process.alive?/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#alive?/1) and [Process.sleep/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#sleep/1) to check if the process is alive after two seconds. [Process.alive?/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#alive?/1) should return `true`.

```elixir

```

Use [Process.spawn/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#spawn/2) and [Process.sleep/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#sleep/1) to spawn a process that sleeps for five seconds. Use [Process.alive?/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#alive?/1) and [Process.sleep/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#sleep/1) to check if the process is alive after six seconds. [Process.alive?/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#alive?/1) should return `false`.

```elixir

```

## Process.send_after/4

Use [Process.send_after/4](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#send_after/4) and `self()` to send the process for the Elixir cell below a message after two seconds. Use [receive](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#receive/1) in the same cell to receive the message.

```elixir

```

Use [Process.spawn/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#spawn/3) to and [receive](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#receive/1) to spawn a process that waits to receive a message. Use [Process.send_after/4](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#send_after/4) to send the spawned process a message after two seconds.

```elixir

```

## Process.exit/2

Use [Process.spawn/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#spawn/2) and [Process.sleep/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#sleep/1) to spawn a process that sleeps for five seconds. Print `"I started"` before sleeping, and `"I finished"` after sleeping to prove if the process finishes sleeping or not. Use [Process.exit/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#exit/2) with the `:normal` exit reason to kill the spawned process.

Once finished, switch the exit reason to `:kill` to demonstrate that the process is unlinked, because it does not crash the calling process.

```elixir

```

Use [Kernel.spawn_link/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#spawn_link/1) and [Process.sleep/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#sleep/1) to spawn a linked process that sleeps for five seconds. Use [Process.exit/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#exit/2) with the `:normal` exit reason to kill the spawned process.

Notice that the Livebook does not crash. Switch the exit reason to `:kill` and notice that the Livebook does crash. Comment out your solution to avoid crashing Livebook.

```elixir

```
