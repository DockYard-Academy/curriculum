## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Fun Formulas

As developers, it's our job to translate business requirements into something that the computer understands.

These exercises will have you convert a common formula into an Elixir program.

## Loading Bar Percentage

We often need to display loading bars to the user. Loading bars use the current **percentage** they have finished loading in order to display the loading progress.

You can calculate the percentage with $\frac{actual\ value}{total\ value}\times100$

For example if we complete `7` out of `10` items, we would be `70.0%` complete.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
7 / 10 # 70.0
```

Use arithmetic operators to determine the **percentage** given we have completed `12` out of `42` items.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
actual = 12
total = 42

actual / total
```

</details>

```elixir

```

## Rocket Ship

We're building a rocket ship app to teach people about physics.

Users can enter the `mass` and `acceleration` of a ship to visualize the `force` generated.

Given that ${mass} * {acceleration} = force$, calculate the force when mass is `10` and acceleration is `50`.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
mass = 10
acceleration = 50

mass * acceleration
```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

## What Do You Tip?

It's common in many cultures to leave a tip whenever you buy a meal. It's common to calculate the tip as a percentage of the meal.

Given the initial cost of a meal is `20`, and you want to leave a `15%` tip, use arithmetic operators to determine the total cost of the meal.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
initial_cost = 20
tip_percent = 1.15

initial_cost * tip_percent
```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir

```

## Pythagorean Theorum

To calculate the longest side of a triangle we use $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

Given a triangle where side $a$ is `4`, and side $b$ is `10`, calculate $c^2$

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
a = 4
b = 10

a ** 2 + b ** 2
```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir

```

## Bonus: Square Root

Earlier we calculated $c^2$ for pythagoream theorum. Given $c^2$ is `116` determine the square root of $c^2$ to calculate $c$.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
c_squared = 116
:math.sqrt(c_squared)
```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir

```

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the curriculum folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.
Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-fun_formulas
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish fun formulas exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-fun_formulas
```
