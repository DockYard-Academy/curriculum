# RPG Dialogue

## Overview

In this exercise, you're going to create a `Dialogue` module that takes an an `Character` 
struct and generates dialogue for an RPG (Role Playing Game).

### Create A Character Struct

In the Elixir cell below, create an `Character` struct.

* enforce that characters have a `:name`.
* characters can have a `:class` that will be either `:wizard`, `:rogue`, or `:warrior`.
* characters can have a `:weapon` that will be either `:sword`, `:dagger`, or `:staff`.

```elixir

```

Create instances of character structs with the following information:

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Arthur {
    class: :warrior
    weapon: :sword
  }
  class Gandalf {
    class: :wizard
    weapon: :staff
  }
  class Jarlaxle {
    class: :rogue
    weapon: :daggers
  }
```

### Create A Dialogue Module

In the Elixir cell below.

* Create an `Dialogue.greet/1` function which accepts a character and returns

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
"Hello, my name is #{character.name}"
```

* Create an `Dialogue.attack/2` function which accepts a character and an enemy name as a string. 
  <!-- livebook:{"force_markdown": true} -->

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
"I attack the #{enemy} with my #{character.weapon}"
```

* Create a `Dialogue.relinquish_weapon/1` function which returns different dialogue depending on the character's class.

  * `:rogue`: `"Fine, have my #{character.weapon}. I have more hidden anyway"`
  * `:wizard`: `"You would not part an old man from his walking stick?"`
  * `:warrior`: `"Have my #{character.weapon} then!"`
  * if the character has no class: `"My Precious!"`

* Create a function `matching_weapon/1` that returns different dialogue depending on
  the character's class and weapon.

  * `:wizard` and `:staff`: `"My lovely magical staff."`
  * `:rogue` and `:dagger`: `"Hidden and deadly."`
  * `:warrior` and `:sword`: `"My noble sword!"`
  * any other combination: `"I'm not sure a #{character.weapon} suits a #{character.class}."`

```elixir

```
