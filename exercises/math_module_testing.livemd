## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Math Module Testing

Generally, we can split up our test suite into test cases. Each test case may require many assertions.

For this exercises, we're going to test a `Math` module that abstracts the operators for adding different data types together, like so.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Math.add(4, 4) # 
Math.add("a", "b") # "ab"
Math.add([1], [2]) # [1, 2]
```

Our **Happy-path** test cases (where our code is used as expected) could be the following.

`Math.add/2`

* add two integers
* add two strings
* add two lists

`Math.subtract/2`

* subtract two integers
* subtract two strings
* subtract two lists

We also want to consider **edge-case** test cases, also called **sad-path** or **unhappy path** when things go wrong, or the code is misused. For example, we might consider the following cases.

`Math.add/2`

* add a valid data type (integer, string, list) and an invalid data type.
* add two invalid data types.
* add two empty lists.
* add two empty strings.
* add a string by an empty string.
* add a list by an empty list.

`Math.subtract/2`

* subtract a valid data type (integer, string, list) and an invalid data type.
* subtract two invalid data types.
* subtract two empty lists.
* subtract two empty strings.
* subtract a string by an empty string.
* subtract a list by an empty list.

There can be a deceptive number of edge cases to consider. For example, we could build a growing list of edge-case permutations for each data type we want the `Math` module to handle.

Here, we've colored happy path tests green and edge-case tests yellow.

![](images/test%20cases.png)

By planning test cases, we can anticipate possible edge cases and ensure we understand the desired behavior of the feature.

Test and implement a `Math` module. Include at least two assertions for each happy path test case (**strings**, **lists**, and **integers**.)

```elixir
defmodule Math do
end
```

### Bonus: Edge Cases

Decide how to handle calling the `Math.add/2` and `Math.subtract/2` functions with invalid data.
For example, you might raise a [FunctionClauseError](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/FunctionClauseError.html) using guards.

Note that if you expect to raise an error, it's usually idiomatic to name our functions using a bang `!` symbol, so `Math.add/2` and `Math.subtract/2` should be renamed to `Math.add!/2` and `Math.subtract!/2`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Math.add!(1, 1)
2

Math.add!(%{}, %{})
** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in Math.add/2  
```

Alternatively or in addition, you might choose to change the return value to an `{:ok, value}` tuple or `{:error, error}` tuple.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Math.add(%{}, %{})
{:error, :invalid_data}
```

Test and implement these edge cases on your `Math` module above.

## Commit Your Progress

Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-math_module_testing
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish math module testing exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-math_module_testing
```
