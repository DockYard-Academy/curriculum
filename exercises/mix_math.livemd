## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Mix Math

To learn how to create a mix project, you're going to recreate a familiar exercise of
building a `Math` module that can abstract away the operators for adding different data types.

It should be able to handle adding `strings`, `integers`, `floats`, `lists`, and `maps`.

You'll use **Dialyzer** to create type specifications and **Credo** to ensure code consistency.

You will also use **ExUnit** and **DocTests** to create a comprehensive suite of tests and documentation.

After creating the fully functional `Math` module, you will document the project with **HexDoc**.

## Create A New Mix Project

Using the command line, create a new project in the `projects` folder called `math`.

```
mix new math
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

## Configure Dialyzer

Add the following to your dependencies in `mix.exs`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
{:dialyxir, "~> 1.0", only: [:dev], runtime: false}
```

Run the following in the command line to ensure Dialyzer is working correctly:

```
mix deps.get
mix dialyzer
```

## Configure Credo

Add the following to your dependencies in `mix.exs`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
{:credo, "~> 1.6", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false}
```

Run the following in the command line to ensure Credo is working correctly:

```
mix deps.get
mix credo
```

## Configure ExDoc

Add the following to your dependencies in `mix.exs`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
{:ex_doc, "~> 0.27", only: :dev, runtime: false}
```

Run the following in the command line to ensure `ExDoc` is working correctly.

```
mix deps.get
mix docs
```

Then open the generated `doc/index.html` to see the project documentation. You will need
to re-run `mix docs` if you wish to update the documentation.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

## Doc Test Cases

In the `math.exs` file create a full suite of doctests for the `Math` module.

### add/2

Create a suite of doc tests to represent the following cases.

* adding two numbers
* adding (concatenate) two strings
* adding two lists
* adding two maps.

For example:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir

Math.add(1, 1)
2

Math.add("1", "1")
"11"

Math.add([1], [2])
[1, 2]

Math.add(%{1 => 1}, %{2 => 2})
%{1 => 1, 2 => 2}
```

## Comprehensive ExUnit Tests (Reading)

The current doctests are not comprehensive enough to properly test functionality.

For example, you can pass the doc tests by simply returning the same output like so:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
# math.exs

@doc ~S"""
  Adds two similar data types together.

  ## Examples

  iex> Math.add("1", "1")
  "11"
"""

def add(string1, string2) do
  "11"
end
```

This passing test is a **false-positive** because it would pass even though the implementation
is incomplete.

Tests are more comprehensive when there are fewer or no possible implementations that produce
false positives.

For example, the following test is more comprehensive but can still
produce a false positive.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
# math_test.exs
test "add/2 add two numbers" do
  assert Math.add(1, 1) == 2
  assert Math.add(2, 1) == 3
end

# math.ex
def add(number1, number2) do
  if number1 == 1 do
    2
  else
    3
  end
end
```

Randomized values can make your tests more comprehensive.

For example, the following test should ensure that `Math.add/2` works correctly with two integers.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
# math_test.exs
test "add/2 two random integers" do
  number1 = Enum.random(0..99)
  number2 = Enum.random(0..99)
  assert Math.add(number1, number2) == number1 + number2
end
```

## False Positives

Add the bare-minimum code necessary to make the current doctests pass. Do not write a
full solution yet.

For example:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  # math.exs
  def add(map1, map2) when is_map(map1) and is_map(map2) do
    %{1 => 1, 2 => 2}
  end

  def add(string1, string2) when is_binary(string1) and is_binary(string2) do
    "11"
  end

  def add(list1, list2) when is_list(list1) and is_list(list2) do
    [1, 2]
  end

  def add(number, number) do
    2
  end
```

## Add Typespecs

Add typespects using `@spec` for the `add/2` function.

You will need a separate `@spec` for each of the following types:

* number
* bitstring
* list
* map

For example:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  @spec add(number(), number()) :: number()
  def add(number1, number2) do
    number1 + number2
  end
```

Run `mix dialyzer` in the command line to ensure that your typespecs are correct.

## Combative Pairing (Partner Exercise)

### add/2

Create a comprehensive ExUnit test for the following test cases:

* adding two integers
* adding two floats
* adding two lists
* adding two maps

Do not implement the code to make the tests pass yet. Once complete, find a partner.

### Partner Implementation

Complete the following exercise with a partner. One partner will be the **TESTER** and the other
partner will be the **IMPLEMENTER**.

This exercise is best completed through **LiveShare** in Visual Studio Code.

If you do not have a partner, you can complete the exercise being both roles.

Use the test suite created by the **TESTER** in the previous exercise.

As the **IMPLEMENTER**, create a false positive implementation that will make the **TESTER**'s test suite pass.

The **TESTER** will rewrite their tests until the **IMPLEMENTER** cannot think of a way to create a false positive
and must write a valid solution.

Once complete, swap roles and repeat the exercise.

## Complete!

To finish this exercise:

* Ensure your tests all pass.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```
mix test
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

* Ensure your Dialyzer check passes.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```
mix dialyzer
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

* Ensure your Credo check passes.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```
  mix credo
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

* Ensure you have generated the latest documentation.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```
mix docs
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Then make sure to add your changes to git from the `curriculum` folder.

```
git add .
git commit -m "finish mix math exercise"
git push
```

## Edge Case Tests (Bonus)

It's important to consider edge cases with your tests. For example, what do we want
to happen when we use the `Math` module incorrectly?

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
iex> Math.add(%{}, [])
** (ArithmeticError) bad argument in arithmetic expression: %{} + []
    :erlang.+(%{}, [])
    (math 0.1.0) lib/math.ex:40: Math.add/2
```

> Depending on your implementation, you may get a different error than the above.

[ArithmeticError](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/ArithmeticError.html) is not particularly clear. Instead, use `assert_raise` to test that we
raise a [FunctionClauseError](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/FunctionClauseError.html). Then, write the code necessary to make the test pass.

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the curriculum folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.
Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-mix_math
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish mix math exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-mix_math
```
