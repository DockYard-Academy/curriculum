## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Mix

[Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html) is a build tool that ships with Elixir that automates tasks for creating, compiling, and testing your application.

We start a new Mix application by running the following in the command line.

```
mix new app_name
```

Where `app_name` is the name of the project.

### Your Turn

Create a `hello_world` application in this course's `projects` folder.

You should notice that the command generated several files.

```
$ mix new hello_world
* creating README.md
* creating .formatter.exs
* creating .gitignore
* creating mix.exs
* creating lib
* creating lib/hello_world.ex
* creating test
* creating test/test_helper.exs
* creating test/hello_world_test.exs

Your Mix project was created successfully.
You can use "mix" to compile it, test it, and more:

    cd hello_world
    mix test

Run "mix help" for more commands.
```

Your project should have the following file and folder structure.

```
hello_world/
  lib/
    hello_world.ex
  test/
    hello_world_test.exs
    test_helper.exs
  .formatter.exs
  .gitignore
  mix.exs
  README.md
```

We'll walk through the mix project structure and how you can build Elixir applications.

## The `lib` Folder

The `lib/` folder contains the files for the project. We start with a single module
named after the project. You should have a `HelloWorld` module in the `lib/hello_world.ex` file.

We use `@moduledoc` and `@doc`  to document our code.

```elixir
defmodule HelloWorld do
  @moduledoc """
  Documentation for `HelloWorld`.
  """

  @doc """
  Hello world.

  ## Examples

      iex> HelloWorld.hello()
      :world

  """
  def hello do
    :world
  end
end
```

## Running A Mix Project

To execute the Elixir code for our Mix project, you can load the project into the IEx Shell
by running the following command in the project folder.

```
iex -S mix
```

Now, all of the `.ex` files and modules under the `lib/` folder are available in the [IEx](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html) shell environment.

[Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html) ignores `.exs` files, so any modules in a `.exs` file will not be available in the [IEx](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html) shell.

### Your Turn

Load your project into the IEx Shell.

```
iex -S mix
```

Call the `hello/0` function.

```
iex> HelloWorld.hello()
:world
```

Notice that the `iex -S mix` command compiles your project into the `_build` folder. This folder contains `.beam` files which are executable files generated by the Erlang compiler.

You can also compile the project by running `mix compile` in the command line.

## Tests

[ExUnit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.html) is a built-in testing framework. Test files are under the `test/` folder in `.exs` files.

In your `hello_world` project, there should be an example test file `test/hello_world_test.exs` with
the following content.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
defmodule HelloWorldTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  doctest HelloWorld

  test "greets the world" do
    assert HelloWorld.hello() == :world
  end
end
```

Test files generally correspond to another file in the `lib/` folder.

For example, a `lib/greeting/hola.ex` file might have a corresponding `test/greeting/hola_test.exs` file.

We will dive deeper into how to test Elixir projects in the [ExUnit](exunit.livemd) section.

For now, know that you can execute all of your tests by running the following in the command line.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
$ mix test
```

### Your Turn

Run `mix test` in your `hello_world` project folder from the command line, and you
should see an output similar to the following.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Compiling 1 file (.ex)
Generated hello_world app
..

Finished in 0.02 seconds (0.00s async, 0.02s sync)
1 doctest, 1 test, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 768874
```

## File and Module Names

Mix compiles all `.ex` files under the `lib/` folder and bundles them together into a project.

Generally, Elixir projects organize modules under the main project namespace.

So all of the modules in the `HelloWorld` application would be grouped under the `HelloWorld` namespace.

For example, a new `Greeting` module would be defined under `HelloWorld.Greeting`.

```elixir
defmodule HelloWorld.Greeting do
  def salutations(name) do
    "Salutations, #{name}!"
  end
end
```

Nested modules generally
relate to each other, often sub-modules deal with a more specific application of the higher-level module.

For example, a `Formal` module would be under the `Greeting` module.

```elixir
defmodule HelloWorld.Greeting.Formal do
  def charmed() do
    "Charmed, I'm sure."
  end
end
```

While not enforced, module and file structure often follow a pattern, where the module name matches its folder and file.

For example, the `HelloWorld.Greeting.Formal` module would be in a `lib/greeting/formal.ex` file,
and the `HelloWorld.Greeting` will be in the `lib/greeting.ex` file.

```
lib/
  greeting.ex
  hello_world.ex
  greeting/
    formal.ex
```

### Your Turn

Modules can call functions from any other modules in `.ex` files under the `lib/` folder,
just as you have already seen in livebook cells.

```elixir
defmodule ModuleA do
  def run do
    "A"
  end
end

defmodule ModuleB do
  def run do
    ModuleA.run() <> "B"
  end
end

ModuleB.run()
```

In your `hello_world` application, create a new module, `HelloWorld.Name` in a `lib/name.ex` file, which will return a random name.

```elixir
defmodule HelloWorld.Name do
  def random do
    Enum.random(["Peter", "Bruce", "Tony"])
  end
end
```

Then, call the `HelloWorld.Name.random/0` function from the `HelloWorld` module in `hello_world.ex`.

```elixir
defmodule HelloWorld do
  def hello do
    "Hello, #{HelloWorld.Name.random()}."
  end
end
```

Run your project in the [IEx](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html) shell and ensure the `HelloWorld.hello/0` function works as expected.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
$ iex -S mix
iex> HelloWorld.hello()
"Hello, Peter."
```

## Mix.exs

The `mix.exs` file's main responsibility is to configure the mix project.

It defines two public functions, `project/0` and `application/0`.

The `project/0` function returns project configuration such as the project name, current version, and installed dependencies. The `project/0` function relies on the private `deps/0` function to provide a list of dependencies.

The `application/0` function returns application configuration used to generate an application manifest file `_build/ebin/hello_world.app`.
This file is used under the hood to run the project. For more, you can see the [Application](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/Application.html) module
on HexDocs.

### Your Turn

Note the original contents of the application manifest `build/ebin/hello_world.app` should be similar to:

```
{application,hello_world,
             [{applications,[kernel,stdlib,elixir,logger]},
              {description,"hello_world"},
              {modules,['Elixir.HelloWorld']},
              {registered,[]},
              {vsn,"0.1.0"}]}.
```

Change the `application/0` function to return an empty list.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
def application do
  []
end
```

Run `mix compile`.

The `_build/ebin/hello_world.app` file will no longer have the `logger` application.

```
{application,hello_world,
             [{applications,[kernel,stdlib,elixir]},
              {description,"hello_world"},
              {modules,['Elixir.HelloWorld']},
              {registered,[]},
              {vsn,"0.1.0"}]}.
```

Mix provides an abstraction for building Elixir applications, so
we don't need to be concerned with these details. However, it's useful to be aware that nothing is magic. Changes to `mix.exs` directly impact the compiled `_build` folder.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
defmodule HelloWorld.MixProject do
  use Mix.Project

  def project do
    [
      app: :hello_world,
      version: "0.1.0",
      elixir: "~> 1.13",
      start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod,
      deps: deps()
    ]
  end

  # Run "mix help compile.app" to learn about applications.
  def application do
    [
      extra_applications: [:logger]
    ]
  end

  # Run "mix help deps" to learn about dependencies.
  defp deps do
    [
      # {:dep_from_hexpm, "~> 0.3.0"},
      # {:dep_from_git, git: "https://github.com/elixir-lang/my_dep.git", tag: "0.1.0"}
    ]
  end
end
```

## Dependencies

Other developers create open-source Elixir projects hosted on GitHub, which we can add as dependencies to our project.

There is a massive ecosystem of Elixir projects to that you don't have to
reinvent the wheel and solve already solved problems. The [Hex.pm](https://hex.pm/) contains a list of available Elixir projects you may find useful. For a curated list, check out the [awesome-elixir](https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir) project.

To install a dependency, include the name of the project and desired version in a tuple inside the `deps/0` function
in `mix.exs`. Notice that `mix.exs` includes comments on installing a dependency using the project version or GitHub URL.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      # {:dep_from_hexpm, "~> 0.3.0"},
      # {:dep_from_git, git: "https://github.com/elixir-lang/my_dep.git", tag: "0.1.0"}
    ]
  end
```

### Your Turn

Add the [Faker](https://hex.pm/packages/faker) project to your `hello_world` application.
[Faker](https://hexdocs.pm/faker/readme.html) provides functions for generating fake data, often useful for randomized test data.

It's often most reliable to check the [Hex page](https://hex.pm/packages/faker) of a project for the latest version.

Ensure you add `:faker` with the latest version to the `deps/0` function in `mix.exs`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:faker, "~> 0.17.0"}
    ]
  end
```

Then run `mix deps.get` to update your project dependencies.

Once installed, you have access to the [Faker](https://hexdocs.pm/faker/readme.html) module.

Use the `Faker.Person.first_name/0` function in your `HelloWorld.hello/0` function.

For more on how to use [Faker](https://hexdocs.pm/faker/readme.html), you can read the [Faker Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/faker/readme.html).

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
def hello do
  "Hello, #{Faker.Person.first_name()}."
end
```

Ensure your `hello/0` function works in the IEx shell.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
iex -S mix
iex> HelloWorld.hello()
"Hello, Salvador." # The name will be random each time.
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Versions

Project [Versions](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Version.html) are generally represented by
`Major.Minor.Patch` numbers.

When installing dependencies, we specify a [version requirement](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Version.html#module-requirements).
We can even specify a version between two numbers using comparison operators. i.e. `>= 2.0.0 and < 2.1.0`,

The locally installed dependency may not exactly match the version requirement, but must belong in the range specified.

The `~>` symbol you see in dependencies means it will never go above its upper bound.

* `~> 2.1` would allow any version below `3.0.0` and above or equal to `2.1.0`.
* `~> 2.1.2` would allow any version below `2.2.0` and above or equal to `2.1.2`.

The [Version documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Version.html) goes into further depth.

You can automatically update project versions by running the following in your command line.

```
mix deps.update example_dep
```

Or with the `--all` option to update all deps.

```
mix deps.update --all
```

## Formatting

The `.formatter.exs` file contains project configuration for how to format Elixir source code files automatically.

You can run `mix format` from the command line in the project folder to format elixir code.

### Your Turn

Indent the code in `hello_world.ex`. Then, run `mix format` and notice the code automatically
formats. If it does not, ensure that you do not have syntax errors that prevent code formatting.

## README.md

Most projects include a README.md file which contains basic information about the project written in markdown.

There is no universal README structure however it's common to include:

* The repository name.
* The project purpose.
* Setup instructions.
* Collaborators on the project.

GitHub pages display the README on the front of the repository page for the project.

When building your own projects,
you'll want to make sure you update the default README to include relevant information.

View the [Markdown cheat-sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a quick guide on markdown syntax.

## Mix Environments

Mix projects can run in different environments. The default environment is your development `:dev` environment.

Run your `hello_world` project in the IEx shell and call `Mix.env()` to see that `:dev` is the current environment.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
$ iex -S mix
iex> Mix.env()
:dev
```

The project will use the `:test` environment when running tests and `:prod` when deployed to production.

We can change project behavior or configuration based on the current environment. For example,
if you had SMS (text) notifications in your project, you might want to disable them in the `:dev` and `:test`
environment to ensure that developers don't accidentally send out text messages to users.
