## Create A New Mix Project

Using the command line, create a new project called `games`.

```
mix new games
```

We're going to use this project to build several different games.

Initialize the project with git. Make sure it is not already in a git managed folder.

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initialize mix project"
```

You should create a [new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new) for this project so that you can push your changes and manage it using source control.

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the curriculum folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.
Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-games_setup
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish games setup exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-games_setup
```
