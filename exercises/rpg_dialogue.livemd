## Overview

In this exercise, you're going to generate dialogue for an RPG (Role Playing Game).
This lesson is designed to provide you an opportunity to practice structs and control flow.

### Create A Character Struct

In the Elixir cell below, define a `Character` struct with a `:name`, `:class`, and `:weapon`.
Enforce that the `:name` property exists.

```elixir
defmodule Character do
end

Utils.test(:define_character_struct, Character)
```

Create character structs with the following information:

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Arthur {
    class: "warrior"
    weapon: "sword"
  }
  class Gandalf {
    class: "wizard"
    weapon: "staff"
  }
  class Jarlaxle {
    class: "rogue"
    weapon: "daggers"
  }
```

Replace `nil` with each struct.

```elixir
arthur = nil
gandalf = nil
jarlaxle = nil

Utils.test(:character_structs, [arthur, gandalf, jarlaxle])
```

### Create A Dialogue Module

In the Elixir cell below.

* Create a `Dialogue.greet/1` function which accepts a character struct and returns the following dialogue.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
character = %Character{name: "Peter"}
Dialogue.greet(character)
"Hello, my name is Peter."
```

* Create a `Dialogue.attack/2` function which accepts a character and returns the following dialogue.
  ```elixir
  character = %Character{name: "Arthur", weapon: "sword"}
  enemy = "Mordred"

  Dialogue.attack(character, enemy)
  "Arthur attacks Mordred with a sword."
  ```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

* Create a `Dialogue.relinquish_weapon/1` function which returns different dialogue depending on the character's class.
  * `"rogue"`: `"Fine, have my #{character.weapon}. I have more hidden anyway."`
  * `"wizard"`: `"You would not part an old man from his walking stick?"`
  * `"warrior"`: `"Have my #{character.weapon} then!"`
  * any other class: `"My precious!"`

For example,

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
character = %Character{name: "Vax", class: "rogue", weapon: "daggers"}

Dialogue.relinquish_weapon(character)
"Fine, have my daggers. I have more hidden anyway."
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

* Create a function `Dialogue.matching_weapon/1` that returns different dialogue depending on
  the character's class and weapon.
  * `"wizard"` and `"staff"`: `"My lovely magical staff."`
  * `"rogue"` and `"daggers"`: `"Hidden and deadly."`
  * `"warrior"` and `"sword"`: `"My noble sword!"`
  * any class and no weapon (`nil`): `"I'm unarmed!"`
  * any other combination: `"I'm not sure a #{character.weapon} suits a #{character.class}."`

For example,

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
character = %Character{name: "Vax", class: "rogue", weapon: "daggers"}
Dialogue.relinquish_weapon(character)
"Hidden and deadly."

character = %Character{name: "Taako", class: "wizard", weapon: "mace"}
Dialogue.relinquish_weapon(character)
"I'm not sure a mace suits a wizard."
```

```elixir
defmodule Dialogue do
  def greet(character) do
  end

  def attack(character, enemy) do
  end

  def relinquish_weapon(character) do
  end

  def matching_weapon(character) do
  end
end

Utils.test(:character_dialogue, Dialogue)
```
