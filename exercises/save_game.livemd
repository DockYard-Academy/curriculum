## Save Game

Many games have a Save function, which allows players to save the current state of the game.
In some cases, the saved game is stored in a save file.

We're going to recreate the Save functionality of a video game using the file system.

The game will store some arbitrary Elixir term in a given file name.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
game_data = %{
  character_name: "Peter Parker",
  level: 10,
  current_location: "New York"
}

Game.save(game_data, "save file 1")
```

Then we should be able to retrieve the saved data given the file name.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
%{
  character_name: "Peter Parker",
  level: 10,
  current_location: "New York"
} = Game.retrieve("save file 1")
```

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
defmodule Game do
  def save(data, filename) do
  end

  def retrieve(filename) do
  end
end
```
