## Create A New Mix Project

Using the command line, create a new project in the `projects` folder called `games`.

```
mix new games
```

## Create A Rock Paper Scissors Game

You're going to create a rock paper scissors game where players will play against an AI which randomly chooses
rock, paper, or scissors.

You should be able to start your project by running the following from the `game` folder in
the command line.

```
iex -S mix
```

Then you can play the game in a `Games.RockPaperScissors` module.
Each time the player plays the game, it should generate a random choice for the opponent, and
display a custom message of your choosing to let the player know they won or lost.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
# randomly generated :scissors for the opponent
iex> Games.RockPaperScissors.play(:rock)
"You win! :rock beats :scissors."

# randomly generated :paper for the opponent
iex> Games.RockPaperScissors.play(:rock)
"You lose! :paper beats :rock."

# randomly generated :rock for the opponent
iex> Games.RockPaperScissors.play(:rock)
"It's a tie!"
```

## (Bonus) Save Score

Ever time you play, you should save a running total of your wins, loses, and draws.
You should be able to retrieve the current tally like so:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Game.RockPaperScissors.score()
%{wins: 1, loses: 1, draws: 0}
```

You may choose to persist the score between sessions (using the file system),
or keep a running tally in memory (using a process).

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the project folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish games rock paper scissors exercise"
```
