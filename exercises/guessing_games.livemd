## Guess the Word

Create a word guessing game. Manually bind a `guess` and an `answer`. Return `"Correct"` if the guess is equal to the answer, and otherwise return `"Incorrect."`

Ensure your solutions works for both an incorrect and correct player guess.

  <summary>Example Solution</summary>

  ```elixir
  guess = "hello"
  answer = "hello"

  guess == answer && "Correct!" || "Incorrect."
  ```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir

```

## Bonus: Guess the Random Word

We can use [Enum.random/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#random/1) to pick a random value from a list.

```elixir
Enum.random(["hello", "hi", "howdy"])
```

Armed with this knowledge, you're going to create a word guessing game.

* Bind a variable `guess` to the player's guess as a string.
* Bind a variable `answer` to a random word (you may create a list of random words to choose from)
* If the `guess` matches the answer, return `"Correct!"`, otherwise return `"Incorrect."`.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <summary>Example Solution</summary>

  ```elixir
  guess = "hello"
  answer = Enum.random(["hello", "hi", "howdy"])

  guess == answer && "Correct!" || "Incorrect."
  ```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir

```

## Bonus: Guess the Number

We can generate a random integer between two values by providing a range to [Enum.random/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#random/1).

```elixir
Enum.random(1..10)
```

Now let's build a number guessing game

* Bind a variable `answer` to a random integer between `1` and `10`.
* Bind a variable `guess` to the player's guess.
* If the `guess` equals `answer`, return `"Correct!"`.
* If the `guess` is lower than the answer, return `"Too low!"`.
* If the `guess` is higher than the answer, return `"Too high!"`.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <summary>Example Solution</summary>


  `cond` allows us to handle several different conditions.

  ```elixir
  guess = Enum.random(1..10)
  answer = 7

  cond do
    guess == answer -> "Correct!"
    guess < answer -> "Too low!"
    guess > answer -> "Too high!"
  end
  ```

  However, we can also solve this problem using purely boolean operators.

  ```elixir
  guess = Enum.random(1..10)
  answer = 7

  guess == answer && "Correct" || guess < answer && "Too low!" || guess > answer && "Too high!"
  ```

  We can optionally simplify the solution by omitting the last condition. However, this could lead to unhandled bugs.
