## Number Wordle

Wordle is a popular game where players get six attempts to guess a word.
They are given feedback clues to guess the word.

* **Green** if the letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
* **Yellow** if the letter is in the word but in the incorrect spot.
* **Gray** if the letter is not in the word.

For example for the word "TOAST" the guess "TARTS" would be

```mermaid
flowchart LR
style 1 fill:green
style 2 fill:gray
style 3 fill:gray
style 4 fill:yellow
style 5 fill:yellow

1[T] --- 2[A] --- 3[R] --- 4[T] --- 5[S]
```

You're going to create a wordle game but for numbers.

It should provide feedback for a guess and and answer.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
NumberWordle.feedback(3689, 3598)
[:green, :gray, :yellow, :yellow]
```

Ensure you handle numbers with multiple of the same digit. For example,

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
NumberWordle.feedback(1113, 2221)
[:yellow, :gray, :gray, :gray]

NumberWordle.feedback(1113, 2211)
[:yellow, :gray, :green, :gray]

NumberWordle.feedback(1111, 2111)
[:gray, :green, :green, :green]
```

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
defmodule NumberWordle do
  def feedback(guess, answer) do
  end
end

Utils.feedback(:number_wordle, NumberWordle)
```
