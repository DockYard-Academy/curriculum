## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators allow us to compare values.

Using comparison operators, we can check if values are equal <span style="background-color: rgb(225 232 240); padding: 0.1rem 0.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem;">==</span>, greater than `>`, less than `<`,
greater than or equal <span style="background-color: rgb(225 232 240); padding: 0.1rem 0.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem;">>=</span>, and less than or equal <span style="background-color: rgb(225 232 240); padding: 0.1rem 0.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem;"><=</span>.

Comparison operators can be used on any value but are most commonly used to compare
integers and floats.

The result of a comparison is a boolean, either `true` or `false`.

For example, if we check that `5` equals `5`, we return `true`.

```elixir
5 == 5
```

### Remembering Greater Than and Less Than

`>` greater than

`<` less than

To help remember which symbol `<` or `>` means greater than or less than, you might find it helpful
to remember that the statement is `true` if the larger number goes on the larger side.

Some people find it helpful to visualize the statement as an alligator eating. And the alligator always wants
the biggest meal.

```elixir
# aligator wants biggest meal. The biggest number is `10` so return true.
10 > 2
```

```elixir
# aligator wants biggest meal. The biggest number is `10`, but it eats `2` so return false.
10 < 2
```

### Strictly Equals

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

There are two operators for checking equality in Elixir. `===` will check if two values
are strictly equal in both value and type. So despite having  the same numerical value,
`1` does not equal `1.0` because integers and floats are not the same types.

```elixir
1 === 1.0
```

However, if you only care about the numerical value and not the data type, you can use only
two equals signs instead of three `==`

```elixir
1.0 == 1
```

### Your Turn

Using comparison operators, determine if `10 + 10 * 15` is greater than `(10 + 10) * 15`.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
10 + 10 * 15 > (10 + 10) * 15
```

</details>

```elixir

```

Using comparisons operators, determine if `4 ** 6` is equal to `4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4`.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
4 ** 6 == 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4
```

</details>

```elixir

```

Using comparison operators, determine if `100 / 2` is strictly equal to `50`.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
100 / 2 === 50
```

</details>

```elixir

```

## Comparing Different Data Types

You can compare different data types to each other in the following [Sorting Order](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/master/operators.html#term-ordering).

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
number < atom < reference < function < port < pid < tuple < map < list < bitstring
```

You'll notice several data types that you may not be familiar with above. Don't worry. There's no need to memorize this sorting order nor know all of these data types.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Comparisons Strings

When comparing strings, they compare based on alphabetical order. Letters earlier
in the alphabet are evaluated as smaller than letters later in the alphabet.

```elixir
"a" < "z"
```

Capital letters are always less than lowercase letters regardless of alphabetical order.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
"Z" < "a"
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

Use comparison operators to determine if `"hello"` is equal to `"hello"`.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
"hello" == "hello"
```

</details>

```elixir

```
