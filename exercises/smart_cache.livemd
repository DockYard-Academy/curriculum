## Smart Cache

A simple implementation of Fibonacci  $fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n - 2)$
is very computationally expensive and creates a lot of duplicated work.

```elixir
defmodule Fib do
  def of(1), do: 0
  def of(2), do: 1
  def of(n), do: of(n - 1) + of(n - 2)
end

Fib.of(30)
```

For example, `Fib.of(30)` calculates `Fib.of(29)` and `Fib.of(28)`.
Which in turn calculates both:

* `Fib.of(28)` and `Fib.of(27)`.
* `Fib.of(27)` and `Fib.of(26)`.

```elixir
Fib.of(30) == Fib.of(29) + Fib.of(28)
Fib.of(29) + Fib.of(28) == Fib.of(28) + Fib.of(27) + Fib.of(27) + Fib.of(26)
```

You can see that we're calculating `Fib.of(27)` twice in only the first step. This
issue of duplicating work gets worse and worse the further we get in the execution.

To avoid duplicated work, Use [Agent](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Agent.html) to implement a smart cache for the `Fib` module above.

Ensure that you smart cache values as they are computed, rather than pre-caching results.

```elixir
defmodule FibCache do
  def of(n) do
  end
end
```

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the curriculum folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.
Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-smart_cache
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish smart cache exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-smart_cache
```
