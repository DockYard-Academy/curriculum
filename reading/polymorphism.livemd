## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Polymorphism

The word polymorphism comes from the Greek word for "many shapes".
It means essentially the same thing for our programs.
We often want to define a single general behavior, but apply it to different things.

```mermaid
  flowchart
    A[Polymorphic Behavior] --- B[Specific Implementation]
    A --- C[Specific Implementation]
    A --- D[Specific Implementation]
    A --- E[Specific Implementation]
    A --- F[Specific Implementation]
```

Running is a great real-world example of polymorphism. Many different animals run,
and they all run in different ways.

```mermaid
  flowchart
    A[Run] --- B[Cheetahs]
    A --- C[Cats]
    A --- D[Dogs]
    A --- E[Horses]
    A --- F[Humans]
```

For a more technical example, you can think of many devices that need to implement an **off** feature.
You can turn off your computer, your tv, your lights, and your phone. Each needs to do this differently
under the hood, but the behavior is universal.

```mermaid
  flowchart
    A[off] --- B[TV]
    A --- C[Computer]
    A --- D[Phone]
    A --- E[Lights]
```

Anytime you have a universal behavior, but separate implementation depending on some context, it's
an opportunity to use polymorphism to improve the clarity of your code.

You've also been using the `Enum` module which provides polymorphic
behavior for different collection data types.

```mermaid
  flowchart
    A[Enum] --- B[map]
    A --- C[list]
    A --- D[keyword-list]
    A --- E[range]
```

You have also already learned some methods of achieving polymorphism with multi-clause functions.

```elixir
defmodule Greeter do
  def hi(name) do
    "Hi #{name}!"
  end

  def hi(name1, name2) do
    "Hi #{name1} and #{name2}!"
  end

  def hi(_name1, _name2, _name3) do
    "Hi everyone!"
  end
end
```

For example, multiple arity functions could be said to be polymorphic,
They create the same generic behavior but with different implementations depending
on the number of arguments given.

```mermaid
  flowchart
    A[Greeter.hi] --> B[1 person]
    A --> C[2 people]
    A --> D[3 people]
```

Polymorphism can be achieved through many means. You will learn more about the tools available in
Elixir to produce behavior as you go through the course.

### Your Turn

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Think of an example of polymorphic behavior that you encounter in every day life. What is some
common abstraction you often use which actually requires different specific behavior?

Running is one example, can you think of others?
