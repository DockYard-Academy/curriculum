## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Recursion

Recursion is a function that calls itself.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
b[Function] --> a[Function]
a --> b
```

Recursion creates a loop effect where the function calls itself over and over.

```elixir
defmodule Recursion do
  def loop(n) do
    if n > 0 do
      IO.puts(n)
      loop(n - 1)
    end
  end
end

Recursion.loop(5)
```

This calls the loop function 5 times. Under the hood, this places 5 stack frames on the stack.

We trigger a call to `IO.puts/2` to show that the loop function has been called 5 times with
a different argument.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a["loop(n)"]
  b["loop(n - 1)"]
  c["loop(n - 2)"]
  d["loop(n - 3)"]
  e["loop(n - 4)"]
  f["loop(...)"]
  5["loop(5)"]
  4["loop(4)"]
  3["loop(3)"]
  2["loop(2)"]
  1["loop(1)"]
  5 --> 4 --> 3 --> 2 --> 1
  a --> b --> c --> d --> e --> f
```

Computerphile explains recursion in excellent detail.

## Endless Recursion

We should have some end condition, otherwise, this would run forever. You'll notice that
this Elixir cell never stops running. Under the hood it's calling `Forever.run/0` over and over.

```elixir
defmodule Forever do
  def run do
    run()
  end
end

Forever.run()
```

## Stack Overflow

Coming from another language, you might be surprised that the endless recursion function doesn't crash
in Elixir. In most programming languages, calling a recursive function puts too many stack frames on
the stack, and causes a stack overflow.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

![](images/stack-overflow-without-tail-recursion.png)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

That's because stack memory gets too full (overflowed) storing each stack frame of the recursive call.

### Tail Recursion And Tail-Call Optimization

Since functional programming languages rely so much on recursion, Elixir (and Erlang) implement tail-call
optimization.

Tail-call optimization circumvents adding new stack frames, instead, it reuses the current stack frame
and jumps back to the top of the stack frame. This avoids additional memory consumption.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

![](images/tail-recursion-optimized-stack.png)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Body Recursion

Keep in mind that Elixir can only tail-call optimize your recursive function if the last thing it does
is call itself. That's why it's called **tail** recursion. Otherwise, if the function calls itself in the body,
it's called **body-recursion** and is not optimized.

### Your Turn

Let's prove that **body-recursion** is not optimized. First, open the runtime panel in this livebook.
Press `s` then `r` to open the settings panel. There you can see the current memory consumption.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

![](images/livebook_runtime.PNG)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Next, uncomment and execute the following Elixir cell that uses body recursion. It's a nonsense function
that doesn't do anything, however, it will infinitely call itself in the body of the function.

You'll notice the **Process** memory consumption will increase, and eventually, the cell will abort.
You may need to click the **Connect** button to reconnect the Elixir runtime.

```elixir
# defmodule Body do
#   def recursion([head | tail]) do
#     recursion(tail ++ tail) ++ [head]
#   end
# end

# Body.recursion([1,2,3])
```

Make sure you comment out the code above, otherwise Livebook will keep disconnecting.

## Using Recursion

So why is recursion useful? Well, it's how we achieve a great deal of functionality in Elixir.
For example, many functions in the `Enum` module use recursion under the hood.

Recursion allows us to accomplish enumeration.

For example, we could use recursion to enumerate through and sum the elements in a list.

```elixir
defmodule Recursion do
  def sum(list, accumulator \\ 0) do
    case list do
      [] -> accumulator
      [head | tail] -> sum(tail, accumulator + head)
    end
  end
end

Recursion.sum([1, 2, 3], 0)
```

We enumerate through the list by recursively calling `sum/2` on the tail of the list and building
an accumulator. In this case, the initial accumulator is `0`.

Each element in the list adds to the accumulator. `1` + `2` + `3` = `6` so the function returns `6`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
sum1["sum([1, 2, 3], 0)"]
sum2["sum([2, 3], 1)"]
sum3["sum([3], 3)"]
sum4["sum([], 6)"]

sum1 --> sum2 --> sum3 --> sum4 --> 6
```

Walking through the function we bind `list` to `[1, 2, 3]` and accumulator to 0.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  def sum(list, accumulator) do
    case list do
      # [] -> accumulator
      [head | tail] -> sum(tail, accumulator + head)
    end
  end
```

`list` is not empty so the program recursively calls `sum([2, 3], 0 + 1)`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  def sum([1, 2, 3], 0) do
    case [1, 2, 3] do
      # [] -> accumulator
      [1 | [2, 3]] -> sum([2, 3], 0 + 1)
    end
  end
```

`list` is still not empty, so the program recursively calls `sum([3], 1 + 2)`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  def sum([2, 3], 1) do
    case [2, 3] do
      # [] -> accumulator
      [2 | [3]] -> sum([3], 1 + 2)
    end
  end
```

`list` is still not empty, so the program recursively calls `sum([], 3 + 3)`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  def sum([3], 3) do
    case [3] do
      # [] -> accumulator
      [3 | []] -> sum([], 3 + 3)
    end
  end
```

`list` is empty, so the program returns the accumulator (`6`).

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  def sum([],  6) do
    case [] do
      [] -> 6
      # [head | tail] -> sum(tail, accumulator + head)
    end
  end
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Rather than using case statements, it's common to use different function clauses
to handle the base case. The base case is when the function returns a value instead of making a recursive call.

In the `Recursion` module, the base case is when the `list` is empty and `sum/2` returns the `accumulator`.

With multiple function clauses, the `Recursion` module could instead be implemented like so:

```elixir
defmodule Recursion do
  def sum([], accumulator), do: accumulator
  def sum([head | tail], accumulator), do: sum(tail, accumulator + head)
end

Recursion.sum([1, 2, 3], 0)
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, implement a `CustomEnum.map/2` function for lists using recursion.
Do not use the `Enum` module.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
CustomEnum.map([1, 2, 3], fn each -> each * 2 end)
[2, 4, 6]
```

```elixir
defmodule CustomEnum do
  def map(list, function) do
  end
end

Utils.feedback(:custom_enum_map, CustomEnum)
```
