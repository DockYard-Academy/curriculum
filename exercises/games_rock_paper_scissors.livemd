## Games: Rock Paper Scissors

In your existing [Games](./games_setup.livemd) project, you're going to create a rock paper scissors game where players will play against an AI which randomly chooses
rock, paper, or scissors.

You should be able to start your project by running the following from the `game` folder in
the command line.

```
iex -S mix
```

Then you can start the rock paper scissors game with a `Games.RockPaperScissors` module.
The game should prompt the user for a choice of `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
iex> Games.RockPaperScissors.play()
(rock/paper/scissors): scissors
```

The game should generate a random AI choice of `"rock"` , `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`, then prompt the user with feedback if they win, lose, or draw.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
# randomly generated paper for the opponent
(rock/paper/scissors): scissors
"You win! scissors beats paper."

# randomly generated scissors for the opponent
(rock/paper/scissors): paper
"You lose! scissors beats paper."

# randomly generated rock for the opponent
(rock/paper/scissors): rock
"It's a tie!"
```
