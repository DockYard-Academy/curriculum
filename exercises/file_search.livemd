## Mastery

Mastery assignments are bonus projects designed to incorporate curriculum concepts at an advanced level. You have complete freedom with how you complete mastery assignments, and may change requirements as you see fit. Each mastery assignment serves as an independent project you may choose to include on your portfolio of projects.

## File Search

Create a `FileSearch` module which can recursively search files in all nested folders.

<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
defmodule FileSearch do
  def all(folder) do
    File.ls!(folder)
    |> Enum.map(fn file_or_folder ->
      path = Path.join(folder, file_or_folder)

      if File.dir?(path) do
        all(path)
      else
        file_or_folder
      end
    end)
    |> List.flatten()
  end

  def by_extension(folder) do
    all(folder) |> Enum.reduce(%{}, fn file_name, acc ->
      extension = Path.extname(file_name)
      Map.update(acc, extension, [file_name], fn files -> [file_name | files] end)
    end)
  end
end
```

</details>

Implement the `FileSearch` module as documented.

```elixir
defmodule FileSearch do
  @moduledoc """
  Documentation for FileSearch
  """

  @doc """
  Find all nested files.

  For example, given the following folder structure
  /main
    /sub1
      file1.txt
    /sub2
      file2.txt
    /sub3
      file3.txt
    file4.txt

  It would return:

  ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt", "file4.txt"]
  """
  def all(folder) do
  end

  @doc """
  Find all nested files and categorize them by their extension.

  For example, given the following folder structure
  /main
    /sub1
      file1.txt
      file1.png
    /sub2
      file2.txt
      file2.png
    /sub3
      file3.txt
      file3.jpg
    file4.txt

  The exact order and return value are up to you as long as it finds all files 
  and categorizes them by file extension.

  For example, it might return the following:

  %{
    ".txt" => ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt", "file4.txt"],
    ".png" => ["file1.png", "file2.png"],
    ".jpg" => ["file3.jpg"]
  }
  """
  def by_extension(folder) do
  end
end
```

### Configure Project As A Script

Create a new mix project.

```
$ mix new file_search
```

Configure the project as a script. You should be able to run the following to list all files.

```
$ mix escript.build
$ ./file_search
```

You should also be able to use a flag to list files by their extension.

```
$ ./file_search --by_type
```

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the curriculum folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.
Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-file_search
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish file search exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-file_search
```
