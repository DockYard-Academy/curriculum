## Setup

Ensure you run the `ea` command to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively,
you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, github: "livebook-dev/kino", override: true},
  {:kino_lab, "~> 0.1.0-dev", github: "jonatanklosko/kino_lab"},
  {:vega_lite, "~> 0.1.3"},
  {:benchee, "~> 0.1"},
  {:ecto, "~> 3.7"},
  {:math, "~> 0.7.0"},
  {:utils, path: "utils"}
])
```

## Habit Tracker

We are building a habit tracking app.

Each task has been assigned a different point value. Users earn points based on the tasks they complete and track progress on daily goals.

```mermaid

  A["Large (30 points)"]
  B["Medium (20 points)"]
  C["Small (5 points)"]
```

### Define Tasks

Bind a variable `small`, `medium`, and `large` to represent the point value as an integer (see above) for each task.

Replace `nil` with your answers.

```elixir
small = nil
medium = nil
large = nil

Utils.test(:habit_tracker_definition, [small, medium, large])
```

### Add Tasks

Given a user has completed a small and medium task, how many points do the have?

Use the `small` and `medium` variables to calculate your answer.

Replace `nil` with your answer below.

```elixir
total_points = nil

Utils.test(:habit_tracker_add, total_points)
```

### Point Goal Percentages

Users define a number of points they would like to earn each day.

What percentage progress have they made if they would like to earn `40` points and have 
completed a `small` and a `medium` task?

Remember that you can calculate percentage with $\frac{points}{point\ goal} * 100$

Replace `nil` with your answer below.

```elixir
point_goal = 40

percentage = nil

Utils.test(:habit_tracker_percentage, percentage)
```

### New Feature Added - Penalties

A new feature is added. Users now must complete tasks within a time limit or recieve a penalty.

Late tasks earn `50%` their normal value. So a task worth `10` points is now worth `5` when late.

A user has completed

* a medium task
* a small task
* a late large task

What is their total point score? Replace `nil` with your answer.

```elixir
total_points = nil

Utils.test(:habit_tracker_penalties_1, total_points)
```

A user has completed

* three late `medium` tasks
* three late `small` tasks.

What is their total point score? Replace `nil` with your answer.

```elixir
total_points = nil

Utils.test(:habit_tracker_penalties_2, total_points)
```

### New Feature Added - Rewards

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

A new feature is added. Users now must complete tasks within a time limit or recieve a penalty.

Early tasks earn an additional `60%` of their normal value. So a task worth `10` points is now worth `16` when early.

A user has completed:

* one early medium task
* one early small
* one late large task

What is their total point score? Replace `nil` with your answer.

```elixir
total_points = nil

Utils.test(:habit_tracker_rewards, total_points)
```

### (BONUS): Add Your Own Feature

Add your own feature to the habit tracking app. Use comments to describe your feature and show
how it would affect calculating the total score and or the total percentage of completed tasks.

```elixir
