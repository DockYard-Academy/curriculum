## Review Questions

Upon completing this lesson, a student should be able to answer the following questions.

* When should we use comprehensions vs [Enum](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html)?
* How do we create a comprehension using generators, filters, and collectables?

## Overview

### Comprehensions

Comprehensions are a convenient way to create new lists, maps, or sets by iterating over an existing collection and applying a set of transformations. They are similar to the [Enum.map/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#map/2), [Enum.filter/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#filter/2), and [Enum.reduce/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#reduce/2) functions but with a more concise syntax.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Generators

A generator is an enumerable the comprehension will enumerate over to produce some output.

```elixir
generator = 1..3

for element <- generator do
  element * 2
end
```

### Filters

A filter is a true/false condition the generator uses to determine which elements should remain.

```elixir
for element <- 1..3, element >= 2 do
  element
end
```

### Collectable

By default, a comprehension collects the result into a list. However, we can specify the data structure to collect the result into using the `:into` collector.

```elixir
for element <- 1..3, into: "" do
  "#{element}"
end
```

## Comprehensions

Let's try to comprehend comprehensions..sorry 🤦‍♂️.

But in all seriousness, you might mistake a comprehension for a **for loop** if you're coming from another programming language. This is not the case! Notice below that the comprehension returns a list.

```elixir
for each <- 1..100 do
  each * 2
end
```

Since the comprehension has a return value, it can be bound to a variable and used elsewhere.

```elixir
my_comprehension =
  for each <- 1..10 do
    each * 2
  end

List.to_tuple(my_comprehension)
```

A comprehension can even be piped into another function. This isn't usually idomatic, but it's possible.

```elixir
for each <- 1..10 do
  each * 2
end
|> List.to_tuple()
```

In an OOP language without immutability, it's common to use
for loops to mutate some variable. We don't do that in Elixir! Notice below that `sum` is still 0.

```elixir
sum = 0

for each <- 1..100 do
  sum = sum + each
end

sum
```

So what are comprehensions for? Currently, we can accomplish the same behavior with the [Enum](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html) module.

```elixir
Enum.map(1..100, fn each -> each * 2 end)
```

A comprehension is syntax sugar. That means that while it may look cleaner, it does not
provide any additional behavior. The [Enum](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html) module and comprehensions can accomplish the same behavior.

A comprehension is broken down into three parts: **generators**, **filters**, and **collectables**.

## Generators

In the following example, the generator is `n <- 1..100` which defines the collection to enumerate over.

```elixir
for n <- 1..100 do
  n
end
```

We can also use pattern matching in the generator to ignore non-matching values.

```elixir
for {:keep, value} <- [keep: 1, keep: 2, filter: 1, filter: 3] do
  value
end
```

Here's where comprehensions get cool and stop looking like loops. You can use multiple comma-separated
generators in a single comprehension.

The comprehension treats each additional generator like a nested loop. For each element in the first loop, it will enumerate through every element in the second loop.

```elixir
for a <- 1..3, b <- 4..6 do
  {a, b}
end
```

```mermaid
flowchart
  subgraph D[generator 2]
    4a[4]
    5a[5]
    6a[6]
  end
  subgraph C[generator 2]
    4b[4]
    5b[5]
    6b[6]
  end
  subgraph B[generator 2]
    4c[4]
    5c[5]
    6c[6]
  end
  subgraph A[generator 1]
    1 --> B
    2 --> C
    3 --> D
  end

```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

We can even use elements from one generator in the next generator.

```elixir
for a <- 1..3, b <- a..0 do
  {a, b}
end
```

```mermaid
flowchart
  subgraph D[generator 2]
    1a[1]
    0a[0]
  end
  subgraph C[generator 2]
    2b[2]
    1b[1]
    0b[0]
  end
  subgraph B[generator 2]
    3c[3]
    2c[2]
    1c[1]
    0c[0]
  end
  subgraph A[generator 1]
    1 --> D
    2 --> C
    3 --> B
  end

```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

There's no real limit to the number of generators that you can use, but
each generator creates another nested loop and therefore has a significant performance impact.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, use a comprehension with a generator of `1..50` to create a list of even integers from `2` to `100`.

```elixir
for n <- 1..50 do
  n * 2
end
```

## Filters

We can use **filters** in a comprehension to filter out elements from the generator.
For example, we could omit all values not divisible by 3.

The comprehension will filter out all values that do not return `true` for the filter function.

```elixir
# finds all values in 1..100 divisible by 3
for n <- 1..100, rem(n, 3) === 0 do
  n
end
```

We can use multiple comma-separated filters.

```elixir
for a <- 1..100, rem(a, 3) === 0, rem(a, 5) === 0 do
  a
end
```

We can also use multiple comma-separated filters and generators. Filters and generators can go in any order.
However, it's likely more clear to group filters together after the generators.

```elixir
for a <- 1..45, b <- 1..5, rem(a, 5) === 0, rem(b, 5) === 0 do
  [a, b]
end
```

That said, you can put the generators and filters in alternating order.

```elixir
for a <- 1..45, rem(a, 5) === 0, b <- 1..5, rem(b, 5) === 0 do
  [a, b]
end
```

The generators must go in the order you want to nest them, otherwise, you change the behavior. The filters
must also go after any generator whose variable they rely on. For example, `b` has not yet been
defined here.

```elixir
for a <- 1..45, rem(a, 5) === 0, rem(b, 5) === 0, b <- 1..5 do
  [a, b]
end
```

### Your Turn

You are given three generators that are ranges of numbers from `1..7`.

Find every trio of numbers in each range that when added together equals seven.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
# expected output
[
  {1, 1, 5},
  {1, 2, 4},
  {1, 3, 3},
  {1, 4, 2},
  {1, 5, 1},
  {2, 1, 4},
  {2, 2, 3},
  {2, 3, 2},
  {2, 4, 1},
  {3, 1, 3},
  {3, 2, 2},
  {3, 3, 1},
  {4, 1, 2},
  {4, 2, 1},
  {5, 1, 1}
]
```

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
for a <- 1..7, b <- 1..7, c <- 1..7, a + b + c == 7 do
  {a, b, c}
end
```

</details>

```elixir
for x <- 1..7, y <- 1..7, z <- 1..7, x + y + z == 7 do
  {x, y, z}
end
```

## Collectables

By default, the comprehension returns a list. However, we can accumulate the elements into any value
with the `:into` option. Into works with any collection that you're used to using with the [Enum](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html)
module.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Even without the `:into` option, we can create a comprehension that returns a keyword list by
using tuples with an atom as the first element and any value as the second element.

```elixir
for n <- 1..5 do
  {:"key_#{n}", n}
end
```

Now, since both maps and keyword lists are key-value tuples underneath, we can specify the `:into`
option to instead return a map.

```elixir
for n <- 1..5, into: %{} do
  {:"key_#{n}", n}
end
```

This map could have default values.

```elixir
for n <- 1..5, into: %{default: "hello!"} do
  {:"key_#{n}", n}
end
```

And instead of a map, it can be any data type that implements the [Collectable](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Collectable.html)
protocol.

This includes strings!

```elixir
for n <- 1..10, do: "#{n}", into: "abc"
```

Using a collector can be useful when we're using a comprehension with a non-list enumerable data type, for example when transforming maps.

```elixir
for {key, value} <- %{a: 1, b: 2}, into: %{} do
  {key, value * 2}
end
```

### Your Turn

Given the generator `%{a: 1, b: 2}`, use a comprehension with a collector to convert an atom-key map into a string key map.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
# input
%{a: 1, b: 2}
# output
%{"a" => 1, "b" => 2}
```

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
for {key, value} <- %{a: 1, b: 2}, into: %{} do
  {"#{key}", value}
end
```

</details>

```elixir
for {key, value} <- %{a: 1, b: 2}, into: %{} do
  {"#{key}", value}
end
```

## Why Use A Comprehension?

[Enum.map/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#map/2), [Enum.reduce/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#reduce/2), and [Enum.filter/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#filter/2) can accomplish all of the same functionality as a comprehension. In general, the [Enum](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html) is more broadly used than comprehensions.

Consider using comprehensions as a refactoring tool to improve the clarity of your code. They are particularely useful for building and generating collections of data. It's typically non-idiomatic to use a comprehension when the [Enum](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html) module would work instead.

Avoid over relying on comprehensions, especially if you're from an Object Oriented Programming background and feel tempted to use comprehensions because they feel like for loops. Comprehensions are not for loops! Instead, consider using comprehensions to refactor and improve your code after you've already written it.

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, convert the following `Enum.map` into a comprehension.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Enum.map(1..5, fn each -> each * 2 end)
```

```elixir
for each <- 1..5 do
  each * 2
end
```

In the Elixir cell below, convert the following `Enum.reduce` into a comprehension.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Enum.reduce(["a", "b", "c"], fn each, acc -> acc <> each end)
```

```elixir
for each <- ["a", "b", "c"], do: each, into: ""
```

In the Elixir cell below, convert the following nested `Enum.map` into a comprehension.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Enum.map(1..3, fn a -> Enum.map(1..3, fn b -> {a, b} end) end)
```

```elixir
for a <- 1..3, b <- 1..3, do: {a, b}
```
