## Sign Up Form

It's common for applications to have a sign up form that validates a user's email, password, and other information.

Create a `User` module which validates user's information.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
{:ok, user} =
  User.new(%{
    username: "Peter Parker",
    password: "secret_spider",
    email: "peter@spider.web",
    terms_and_conditions: true
  })
```

We're going to allow any string for the recipient name, domain name, and top level domain.

* `username` (required) a 3-12 character string.
* `password` (required) a 12-50 character string.
* `email` (required) a string in the format `recipient_name@domain_name.top_level_domain`. i.e. `"peter@gmail.com"`.
* `age` (optional) an integer.
* `agreed_to_terms_and_conditions` (required) a boolean which must be `true`.

You should rely on Ecto Changesets and your own custom validation to validate the user information.
Enter your solution below.

```elixir
defmodule User do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  def changeset(%User{} = user, params) do
  end

  def new(params) do
  end
end
```
