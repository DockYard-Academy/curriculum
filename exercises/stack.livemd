## Stack

Test and implement a `Stack` process.

The `Stack` process should store a list as state and `push/2` elements onto the stack, and `pop/2` elements
off of the stack like so.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = Stack.start_link([])
[:one] = Stack.push(pid, :one)
[:two, :one] = Stack.push(pid, :two)
:two = Stack.pop(pid)
:one = Stack.pop(pid)
# return no value when the stack is empty
nil = Stack.pop(pid)
```

Implement and test the `Stack` module. Ensure you have at least one test each for the `push/2` function
and the `pop/1` function.

```elixir
defmodule Stack do
  use GenServer
end

defmodule StackTests do
  use ExUnit.Case
end
```
