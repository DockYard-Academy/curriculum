## Anagram Solver

Two words that contain all the same letters are anagrams.
For example **bored** and **robed** are anagrams.

You are going to create an `AnagramSolver` with a `solve/1` function that accepts a word and 
returns every possible permutation of the anagram. Each permutation does not need to be a real word.

For example,

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown": true} -->
```elixir
AnagramSolver.solve("cat")
[
  "cat",
  "cta",
  "act",
  "atc",
  "tac",
  "tca"
]
```

The Anagram solver is an example of exponential complexity $O(n!)$, because for each letter in the word, you must enumerate through every
other letter. It's helpful to draw a tree to visualize the problem.

```mermaid

  CAT --> C --> A --> T 
  CAT --> C --> T --> A 
  CAT --> A --> C --> T
  CAT --> A --> T --> C
  CAT --> T --> C --> A
  CAT --> T --> A --> C 
```

You can expect that the number of answers for a word of given length `n` will be `n!`.
So a word with 3 letters has 6 solutions, a word with 4 letters has 24 answers, a word with
5 letters has 120 answers.

Enter your solution in the Elixir cell below,

```elixir
defmodule AnagramSolver do
  def solve(word) do
  end
end
```
