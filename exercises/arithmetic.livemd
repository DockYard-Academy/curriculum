## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Balance the Scale

Use integers to balance the scale.

For example, if 10 were on the left and 20 were on the right, you would add `10`
to the left or add `-10` to the right.

## Solve For X

In the Elixir cells below, enter the result of the equation. You should use
[Arithmetic Operators](../reading/arithmetic_operators) rather than solving the equation.

Ten minus two times 5.

```elixir

```

(Ten minus two) times 5.

```elixir

```

Divide 10 by 3.

```elixir

```

Use integer division to divide 10 by 3.
