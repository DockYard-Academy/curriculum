## Create A New Mix Project

Using the command line, create a new project called `games`.

```
mix new games
```

We're going to use this project to build several different games.

Initialize the project with git. Make sure it is not already in a git managed folder.

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initialize mix project"
```

You should create a [new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new) for this project so that you can push your changes and manage it using source control.
