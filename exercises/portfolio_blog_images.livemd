## Images

To learn more about **one-to-one** relationships You're going to add images to blogs in your portfolio project.

* Images **belong to** a Blog.
* Blogs can **have one** image.

Each `Image` record should have a `:blog_id` foreign key and a `:url` field.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Image {
    blog_id: :id
    url: :string
  }
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Image Requirements

Ensure you:

* Can create an associated image from the blog create page using a form with a text input.
* Display the image on the blog show page using an `<img>` html tag.

You do not need to handle uploading images, only storing the text URL of an existing image.

### Bonus: Update Image

Ensure you:

* Can update an associated image from the blog create page using a form with a text input.
