## Review Questions

* What kinds of problems do supervisors solve?
* How do we use supervisors to make our application fault-tolerant?
* Why might we use each supervisor restart strategy (`:one_for_one`, `:one_for_all`, `:rest_for_one`)?

## Fault Tolerance

Elixir and [Open Telecom Platform (OTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform) are fantastic for building highly concurrent and fault-tolerant systems which can handle runtime errors.

Errors happen. We often implement specific error handling for the errors we expect. However, it's impossible to anticipate every possible error. For unexpected errors, Elixir follows a **let it crash** philosophy.

To achieve a fault-tolerant system in Elixir, we leverage concurrency and isolate our system into different processes. These processes share no memory, and a crash in one process cannot crash another.

Therefore, we can let a process crash, and it will not affect the rest of our system.

> it’s somewhat surprising that the core tool for error handling is concurrency.
> In the BEAM world, two concurrent processes are
> completely separated; they share no memory, and a crash in one process can’t by default compromise the execution flow of another.
> Process isolation allows you to confine the negative effects of an error to a single process or a small group of related processes,
> which keeps most of the system functioning normally.

For example, We can spawn a process and raise an error. Unless we explicitly link the process with `spawn_link/1`
The process will die and leave the parent process unaffected.

```elixir
pid =
  spawn(fn ->
    raise "error"
  end)

# Allow The Process Time To Crash
Process.sleep(100)

"I still run."
```

When a linked process crashes, it will also crashed the process that spawned it. Uncomment the code below, and you'll see it crashes the current Livebook process. Re-comment the code when finished.

```elixir
# spawn_link(fn -> Raise "error" End)
```

That means if we start a [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html) (or other process) **unsupervised** it will raise an error if it crashes.

```elixir
defmodule UnsupervisedWorker do
  use GenServer

  def init(state) do
    {:ok, state}
  end

  def handle_info(:crash, _state) do
    raise "crash!"
  end
end
```

Uncomment and run the following code to see it crashes the current Livebook process, then re-comment the code.

```elixir
# {:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(UnsupervisedWorker, [])
# Process.send(pid, :crash, [])
```

The same is true if we manually exit a process using [Process.exit/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#exit/2) with the `:exit` reason. Uncomment and run the following code to see it crashes the current Livebook process, then re-comment the code.

```elixir
# {:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(UnsupervisedWorker, [])
# Process.exit(pid, :exit)
```

If you would like to learn more about fault tolerance and error handling, Joe Armstrong created an incredible video on the subject.

## Supervisors

Instead of crashing the parent process, we can use `Supervisors` to monitor processes and restart them when they die.

The term restart is a bit misleading. To be clear, we cannot restart a process. Restart in this case means that we kill the process and start a new one in its place. However, it's conceptually easier to think of it as restarting.

Why would we want to restart the process? Well, most technical issues are the result of state. Our system gets into a bad state and cannot recover. Turning a system on and off again clears the state and often resolves the issue. Using a [Supervisor](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html) is like adding an automatic on/off switch to your application.

A [Supervisor](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html) monitors one or more child processes. We generally refer to these processes as **workers**.
The [Supervisor](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html) can use different strategies for restarting its child workers. The `:one_for_one` strategy individually restarts any worker that dies.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart
S[Supervisor]
W1[Worker]
W2[Worker]
W3[Worker]

S --> W1
S --> W2
S --> W3
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Here, we define a simple `Worker` process which we'll start under a supervisor.

```elixir
defmodule Worker do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(_opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [], [])
  end

  def init(state) do
    {:ok, state}
  end
end
```

Every supervisor is also a process. The [Supervisor.start_link/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#start_link/2) function accepts a list of child processes and starts the supervisor process. We provide each child as a map with an `:id` and a `:start` signature.

```elixir
children = [
  %{
    id: :worker1,
    start: {Worker, :start_link, [1]}
  },
  %{
    id: :worker2,
    start: {Worker, :start_link, [2]}
  },
  %{
    id: :worker3,
    start: {Worker, :start_link, [3]}
  }
]

{:ok, supervisor_pid} = Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

### Your Turn

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Here, we've used the livebook-exclusive [Kino.Process.sup_tree/2](https://hexdocs.pm/kino/Kino.Process.html#sup_tree/2) function to create a visualization of the above supervision tree.

```elixir
Kino.Process.sup_tree(supervisor_pid)
```

When we kill one of the processes under the supervision tree, it will be restarted. For demonstration purposes only, you can use the [:c.pid/3](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/c.html#pid-3) function from erlang to manually create the `pid` from the diagram above where `727` should be a pid from the diagram above.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
pid = :c.pid(0, 727, 0)
```

Then, kill the process using [Process.exit/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html#exit/2).

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Process.exit(pid, :exit)
```

Re-evaluate the diagram above and you should see a new `Worker` process started with a different pid. Repeat this process to kill each process under the supervisor and see them restarted.

```elixir

```

## Restart Strategies

Supervisors can have different restart strategies that change the behavior of how we handle restarting child processes when one of them dies.

We've seen the above `:one_for_one` strategy. This is the most common strategy, where we restart the child process that died under the supervisor.

However, sometimes we want different restart strategies such as `:one_for_all` and `:rest_for_one`.

### One-For-One

Restart only the worker that crashed.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Supervisor
    Supervisor --> P1
    Supervisor --> P2
    Supervisor --> P3
    Supervisor --> ..
    Supervisor --> Pn

    classDef crashed fill:#fe8888;
    classDef restarted stroke:#0cac08,stroke-width:4px

    class P2 crashed
    class P2 restarted

```

In the diagram above, only P2 crashed, so only P2 will be restarted by the supervisor.

### One-For-All

Restart all of the child workers.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Supervisor
    Supervisor --> P1
    Supervisor --> P2
    Supervisor --> P3
    Supervisor --> ..
    Supervisor --> Pn

    classDef crashed fill:#fe8888;
    classDef terminated fill:#fbab04;
    classDef restarted stroke:#0cac08,stroke-width:4px

    class P2 crashed
    class P1,P3,..,Pn terminated
    class P1,P2,P3,..,Pn restarted
```

P2 crashed, which led to all the other child processes to be terminated, then all the child processes are restarted.

### Rest-For-One

Restart child workers in order after the crashed process.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Supervisor
    Supervisor --> P1
    Supervisor --> P2
    Supervisor --> P3
    Supervisor --> ..
    Supervisor --> Pn

    classDef crashed fill:#fe8888;
    classDef terminated fill:#fbab04;
    classDef restarted stroke:#0cac08,stroke-width:4px

    class P2 crashed
    class P3,..,Pn terminated
    class P2,P3,..,Pn restarted
```

P2 crashed, the child processes after it in the start order are terminated, then P2 and the other terminated child processes are restarted.

## Restart Strategy Examples

To better understand how we can use a supervisor with different restart strategies, we're going to supervise multiple `Bomb` processes that will crash after a specified amount of time.

Here, we've created a `Bomb` process that will send itself a message to cause it to crash after a specified `:bomb_time`.

```elixir
defmodule Bomb do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts)
  end

  @impl true
  def init(opts) do
    bomb_time = Keyword.get(opts, :bomb_time, 2000)
    name = Keyword.get(opts, :name, 2000)

    Process.send_after(self(), :explode, bomb_time)
    {:ok, name}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_info(:explode, name) do
    raise "#{name} Exploded!"
  end
end
```

Each `Bomb` will exist for a specified time and then crash (explode).

* `Bomb 1` will explode after 2 seconds.
* `Bomb 2` will explode after 3 seconds.
* `Bomb 3` will explode after 5 seconds.

We'll reuse these same children in all of our examples.

```elixir
children = [
  %{
    id: :bomb1,
    start: {Bomb, :start_link, [[name: "Bomb 1", bomb_time: 2000]]}
  },
  %{
    id: :bomb2,
    start: {Bomb, :start_link, [[name: "Bomb 2", bomb_time: 3000]]}
  },
  %{
    id: :bomb3,
    start: {Bomb, :start_link, [[name: "Bomb 3", bomb_time: 5000]]}
  }
]
```

### One For One

We'll start the three bombs using the `:one_for_one` strategy.

For the sake of example, we've increased `:max_restarts` to increase the limit of three crashes per five seconds to five crashes per five seconds.

You can go to [Supervisor Options](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#init/2-options)
 on HexDocs for a full list of configuration options.

Each bomb restarts individually without affecting the others,
so the timeline of crashes should be:

* 2 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes.
* 3 seconds: `Bomb 2` crashes.
* 4 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes.
* 5 seconds: `Bomb 3` crashes.

Uncomment and run the cell below to see the timeline of crashes, then re-comment it.

```elixir
# {:ok, supervisor_pid} = Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one, max_restarts: 5)
```

### One For All

If we change the restart strategy to `:one_for_all`, then all processes will be
terminated and restarted when a single process crashes.

So the timeline of crashes will be:

* 2 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes (`Bomb 2` and `Bomb 3` restarted)
* 4 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes (`Bomb 2` and `Bomb 3` restarted)
* 6 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes (`Bomb 2` and `Bomb 3` restarted)
* 8 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes (`Bomb 2` and `Bomb 3` restarted)
* 10 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes (`Bomb 2` and `Bomb 3` restarted)

Notice that `Bomb2` and `Bomb3` will never explode because their timers restart.

Uncomment the line below to observe the timeline of crashes, then re-comment it.

```elixir
# {:ok, supervisor_pid} = Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_all, max_restarts: 5)
```

### Rest For One

Rest for one works like a row of dominoes, where only children defined after the crashed process will be restarted.

If we change the restart strategy to `:rest_for_one`, the processes will restart any
processes ordered after them in the supervisor.

At first, we won't notice any change from the `:one_for_all` strategy. The
timeline will still be:

* 2 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes (`Bomb 2` and `Bomb 3` restarted)
* 4 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes (`Bomb 2` and `Bomb 3` restarted)
* 6 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes (`Bomb 2` and `Bomb 3` restarted)
* 8 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes (`Bomb 2` and `Bomb 3` restarted)
* 10 seconds: `Bomb 1` crashes (`Bomb 2` and `Bomb 3` restarted)

Uncomment the line below to observe the timeline of crashes, then re-comment it.

```elixir
# {:ok, supervisor_pid} = Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :rest_for_one, max_restarts: 5)
```

However, if we change the order of children in the supervisor, only children after the crashed
process will restart.

```elixir
children = [
  %{
    id: :bomb3,
    start: {Bomb, :start_link, [[name: "Bomb 3", bomb_time: 5000]]}
  },
  %{
    id: :bomb1,
    start: {Bomb, :start_link, [[name: "Bomb 1", bomb_time: 2000]]}
  },
  %{
    id: :bomb2,
    start: {Bomb, :start_link, [[name: "Bomb 2", bomb_time: 3000]]}
  }
]
```

So the timeline of crashes would be:

* 2 seconds: `Bomb1` crashes (`Bomb2` restarted)
* 4 seconds: `Bomb1` crashes (`Bomb2` restarted)
* 5 seconds: `Bomb3` crashes (`Bomb1` and `Bomb2` restarted)
* 7 seconds: `Bomb1` crashes (`Bomb2` restarted)
* 9 seconds: `Bomb1` crashes (`Bomb2` restarted)

```elixir
# {:ok, Supervisor_pid} = Supervisor.start_link(children, Strategy: :rest_for_one, Max_restarts: 5)
```

### Your Turn

Start **four** `Bomb` processes under a supervisor with different bomb times. Try each restart strategy `:one_for_one`, `one_for_all`, and `:rest_for_one`. Predict the crash timeline then evaluate your code. Did the result match your prediction?

```elixir

```

## Syntax Sugar

Instead of providing a map with the `:id` and `:start` keys, we can instead provide the child as a tuple. The name of the module will also be the `:id`, and the second value will be the argument passed to `start_link/1`.

```elixir
children = [
  {Bomb, [name: "Syntax Sugar Bomb", bomb_time: 1000]}
]
```

Uncomment the following code to see the crash timeline, then re-comment it.

```elixir
# Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

## Supervised Mix Projects

Supervised mix projects use an [Application](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html) module that defines application callbacks.

The application module is configured in `mix.exs` in the `application/0` function.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
def application do
  [
    extra_applications: [:logger],
    mod: {MyApp.Application, []}
  ]
end
```

The application module typically lives in the project folder in a `my_app/application.ex` file and contains the logic to start the application. In a supervised application, this module starts a supervision tree.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html
  # for more information on OTP Applications
  @moduledoc false

  use Application

  @impl true
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      # Starts a worker by calling: RockPaperScissors.Worker.start_link(arg)
      # {RockPaperScissors.Worker, arg}
    ]

    # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html
    # for other strategies and supported options
    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

We can generate a mix project with all of the above scaffolding using the `--sup` flag, or add it manually to an existing project.

```
mix new my_app --sup
```
