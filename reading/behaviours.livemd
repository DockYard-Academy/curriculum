## Behaviours

Behaviours allow us to create modules that all share a common pattern but need different implementations.

You can define a behaviour, and then two other modules will implement it.

```mermaid

  A[Behaviour] --> B[Module]
  A[Behaviour] --> C[Module]
```

This enforces that both modules will implement a shared **application programming interface**
or **API**. What is an API? Well, in this specific context the API is the set of
public-facing functions in a module. More generically an interface is the point at which two systems
interact. Since we're talking about systems for programming applications, we call it the application
programming interface.

To define a behaviour, we start by defining a module. However, instead of implementing
functions, we create `@callback` module attributes. These @callback module attributes
define the signature of a function.

The signature of a function is the name, params, and expected return value, but not the implementation.
Essentially, it's the expected input, and output types in our program, but not the actual
implementation.

To define the expected return value we use `::` and then the data type we expect to return.
Elixir provides a set of types. You can see the full list of types in the [Typespecs](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/typespecs.html#basic-types)
documentation. For now, we're going to use the `String.t()` type. Some other common
types are `atom()`, `boolean()`, `integer()`, `float()`, and `any()` if you don't require a specific output.

```elixir
defmodule Villain do
  @callback catchphrase() :: String.t()
end
```

Now a module can use the `Villain` behaviour using the `@behaviour` module attribute.
You'll notice that Elixir displays a warning because the `DarthVader` module is supposed
to implement a `catchphrase/0` function.

```elixir
defmodule DarthVader do
  @behaviour Villain
end
```

To remove the warning, we need to implement `my_function/0` and it should return a string.

```elixir
defmodule DarthVader do
  @behaviour Villain
  def catchphrase do
    "No, I am your father."
  end
end

DarthVader.catchphrase()
```

So, why use a behaviour?

Primarily, behaviours ensure that any module that implements the behaviour provides the expected set
of functions and that those functions match the expected function signatures.

Behaviours are another way to achieve `polymorphism`. We can define
a behaviour, and then several different modules can implement that behaviour. Behaviours
allow us to create "templates" for modules to ensure each module is consistent.

The **caller**, which is the place in the code where we call a module's function, can
then have a consistent experience between modules.

```mermaid

  A --> C
  A --> D
  A --> E
  A --> F
  C --> B
  D --> B
  E --> B
  F --> B

  A[Caller]
  B[Behaviour]
  C[Implementation]
  D[Implementation]
  E[Implementation]
  F[Implementation]
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

If the behaviour ever needs to change, we can modify the behaviour, and know which modules
need to be updated thanks to the warnings Elixir provides.

You can also implement behaviours with [dynamic dispatching](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/typespecs-and-behaviours.html#dynamic-dispatch)
which allows the caller to deal with a single module, and swap out the implementation.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid

  A --> B

  B --> C
  B --> D
  B --> E
  B --> F
  A[Caller]
  B[Behaviour]
  C[Implementation]
  D[Implementation]
  E[Implementation]
  F[Implementation]
```

But that's beyond the scope of this lesson.

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, convert the `Pet` module into a behavior.
The `Pet` behavior should define an `@callback` for a `speak/0` function that returns a string.

```elixir
defmodule Pet do
end
```

Once complete, re-evaluate the following module. It should display a warning.

> speak/0 required by behaviour Pet is not implemented (in module Dog)

Add a `speak/0` function to the `Dog` module. When you re-evaluate the cell, the warning should be gone.

```elixir
defmodule Dog do
  @behaviour Pet
end
```
