## Tailwind Components

You're going to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and HTML to mimic a provided image. Create a new HTML file in your projects folder for each exercise.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">
    Hello world!
  </h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## Hoverable Outline Button

Create a button with rounder corners, an underline, the `orange-500` background and `3xl` size text.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

![](images/outline-button.png)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

On hover, the button should change the background color to `orange-500`.

## Card Component

Components like the following are often called **Card Components**. Create a card component matching the following with an image, heading, subtitle, body, and bottom bar decoration.

You can use https://picsum.photos/200/100 to retrieve a fake image:

```html
<img src="https://picsum.photos/200/100"></img>
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Bonus: Clone Component

Front-end developers who focus on building UI often work together with Designers to build out an existing design. While you might not have access to your own designer, you can mimic this experience for further practice.

Go to one of your favourite websites and pick an element on the page. Recreate the element using HTML + Tailwind. You may even create an entire "clone" of the page to really stretch your skills.

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the curriculum folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.
Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-tailwind_css_components
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish tailwind css components exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-tailwind_css_components
```
