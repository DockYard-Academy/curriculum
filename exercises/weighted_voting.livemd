## Weighted Voting

In the previous [Counting Votes](./counting_votes.livemd) exercise, we created a module to count a list of votes. For example, users would vote for their favorite animal to decide if `:birds`, `:dogs`, or `:cats` were more popular.

Now, you're going to create a `WeightedVoting.count/2` that can count the number of votes for a single value such as `:dogs` or `:cats`. provided in a keyword list.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
WeightedVoting.count([cats: 10, dogs: 20, dogs: 20], :dogs)
40
```

You're also going to create a `WeightedVoting.tally/1` function that will count the votes provided in a keyword list, and return the results as a keyword list like so.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
WeightedVoting.tally([cats: 10, dogs: 20, dogs: 20])
[cats: 10, dogs: 40]
```

<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
defmodule WeightedVoting do
  def count(votes, vote_to_count) do
    Enum.reduce(votes, 0, fn {key, value}, acc ->
      if key == vote_to_count do
        acc + value
      else
        acc
      end
    end)
  end

  def tally(votes) do
    Enum.reduce(votes, [], fn {key, vote_count}, acc ->
      Keyword.update(acc, key, vote_count, fn existing_value ->
        existing_value + vote_count
      end)
    end)
  end

  def tally_map(votes) do
    Enum.reduce(votes, %{}, fn {key, vote_count}, acc ->
      Map.update(acc, key, vote_count, fn existing_value ->
        existing_value + vote_count
      end)
    end)
  end
end
```

</details>

Implement the `WeightedVoting` module as documented below.

```elixir
defmodule WeightedVoting do
  @doc """
  Count the total number of votes for some key in a keyword list.

  ## Examples

    iex> WeightedVoting.count([dogs: 20, dogs: 10], :dogs)
    30
    iex> WeightedVoting.count([cats: 10, dogs: 20, dogs: 30], :dogs)
    50
    iex> WeightedVoting.count([cats: 10, dogs: 20, dogs: 10, cats: 30], :cats)
    40
  """
  def count(votes, vote_to_count) do
  end

  @doc """
  Tally the total number of votes in a keyword list, and return
  the results as a keyword list.

  The keyword list should be sorted in alphabetical order.

  ## Examples

    iex> WeightedVoting.tally([dogs: 20, dogs: 10])
    [dogs: 30]
    iex> WeightedVoting.tally([cats: 10, dogs: 20, dogs: 10])
    [cats: 10, dogs: 30]
    iex> WeightedVoting.tally([cats: 10, dogs: 20, cats: 20, dogs: 10, birds: 20])
    [birds: 20, cats: 30, dogs: 30]
  """
  def tally(votes) do
  end
end
```

### Bonus: Tally Map

Create a `WeightedVoting.tally_map/1` function which returns a map instead of a keyword list.
You may copy the following code into the `WeightedVoting` module above to get started.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
  @doc """
  Tally the total number of votes in a keyword list, and return
  the results as a map.

  ## Examples

    iex> WeightedVoting.tally_map([dogs: 20, dogs: 10])
    %{dogs: 30}
    iex> WeightedVoting.tally_map([cats: 10, dogs: 20, dogs: 10])
    %{cats: 10, dogs: 30}
    iex> WeightedVoting.tally_map([cats: 10, dogs: 20, cats: 20, dogs: 10, birds: 20])
    %{birds: 20, cats: 30, dogs: 30}
  """
  def tally_map(votes) do
  end
```
